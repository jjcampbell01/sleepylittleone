## Voice Consultation Setup

The `/consultation` page provides a 5â€‘minute AI voice call powered by Twilio, ElevenLabs, OpenRouter and Pinecone. To run it locally set the following environment variables:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
TWILIO_API_KEY
TWILIO_API_SECRET
TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID
OPENROUTER_API_KEY
PINECONE_API_KEY
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT
PINECONE_INDEX
```

To populate Pinecone with the course transcript, run:

```
npx ts-node scripts/ingest-transcript.ts
```

This ingests `BACKGROUND.md` into your Pinecone index for retrieval during calls.

## Deploying the Netlify Function

The webhook handler lives at `netlify/functions/rebuild-hook.js`.
To deploy it:

1. Install the Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`.
2. Authenticate with Netlify: `netlify login`.
3. Run `netlify deploy` (or `netlify dev` to test locally).

The function will be bundled and available at `/.netlify/functions/rebuild-hook` after deployment.
