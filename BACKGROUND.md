Sleepy Little One: Creating Peaceful Nights

Beginning Your Sleep Journey

Understanding why sleep matters

Picture this: it's 3 AM. Again. Your eyes are burning, your body aches, and as you rock your baby back to sleep for what feels like the hundredth time tonight, you wonder, "Will I ever sleep again?"

I've been exactly where you are.

When I first held my baby in my arms, I was overwhelmed with love—and completely unprepared for what came next. No one warned me that my dreams of peaceful motherhood would dissolve into a fog of exhaustion so thick I could barely remember my own name some days.

It started innocently enough. My baby would stir, I'd nurse him back to sleep, and we'd both drift off again. Easy solution, right? But week by week, those wakings multiplied. One wake-up became three, then five, then—somehow—I found myself with an eight-month-old who woke hourly all night long, accepting nothing but nursing to settle.

The breaking point? Realizing I had begun to dread the sun setting. The mother I wanted to be was disappearing under waves of exhaustion and frustration.

Sound familiar? Remember, every mother who's walked this path has felt these same emotions. Your exhaustion doesn't define your motherhood—it simply shows how deeply you care.

Whether you're facing multiple nightly wake-ups, marathon middle-of-the-night sessions, or simply sensing that better sleep is possible—you've found your way to the right place.

Here's the truth that transformed my family: healthy sleep isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. And contrary to what you might have heard, teaching your child to sleep well isn't selfish—it's one of the most loving gifts you can offer them.

Consider this: sleep deprivation is so effective at breaking down human functioning that it's classified as a form of torture. Research shows that your sleep-deprived brain functions similarly to an intoxicated one. Now imagine what sleep deprivation does to your baby's rapidly developing mind.

When we finally committed to change, something magical happened. Not only did my baby transform into a happier, more engaged little person, but I rediscovered myself as the mother I'd always wanted to be—present, patient, and actually enjoying this precious time instead of just surviving it.

That's the transformation waiting for you. Be gentle with yourself throughout this journey. The fact that you're seeking solutions shows what an incredible mother you already are.

I've now guided hundreds of families through this journey, and I can tell you with absolute certainty: this approach works. It doesn't just improve sleep—it can completely transform your family life.

The science of healthy infant sleep

Hey there, tired parents! First, take a moment to acknowledge how much you've already done for your little one. Your love and dedication shine through, even on the hardest days.

Are you feeling it? That bone-deep exhaustion that comes with the amazing, yet sometimes overwhelming, journey of parenthood? I see you. I’ve been there. Pacing the floor at 3 AM with a fussy little one, wondering if a full night's sleep was ever going to be a thing again. And let me tell you, it can be.

In this course, we're going to dive deep into the world of baby sleep, and more importantly, your sleep. Because let's be real, happy baby, happy parent, right? But how do we get there?

First things first, let's talk science. Did you know that babies aren't born knowing how to sleep through the night? It's a learned skill, just like walking or talking. Think of it like learning to ride a bike. At first, there are wobbles and falls, short bursts of pedaling followed by… well, you know. Sleep is similar. Little ones are learning to connect their sleep cycles, those ups and downs of light and deep sleep. And as they get better at it, longer stretches of peaceful slumber emerge. Research actually shows that this connection of sleep cycles is linked to better moods and even brain development!

So why is this important? Well, while your little one is snoozing, their brain is doing some serious overtime. It's building connections, filing away memories, and releasing those all-important growth hormones. It’s like a little construction crew working the night shift, building a stronger, smarter, more amazing little human.

And guess what? Your sleep matters too! When you're well-rested, you're a better parent, partner, and, let's face it, a better you. Think of your energy like a " sleep battery." When it's empty, everything feels harder. Filling your battery through quality sleep allows you to handle the daily the daily ups and downs of parenthood with more grace and joy. Studies have shown that well-rested parents have lower stress levels, stronger relationships, and are just generally happier campers.

Now comes a powerful exercise. I want you to grab a pen and paper and write down why better sleep is important to you. What's your driving force? Is it seeing your little one thrive? Having more patience and connection with your partner? Or simply reclaiming a bit of yourself amidst the beautiful chaos of parenthood? This “why” will be your North Star on those tough nights, reminding you why you’re on this journey. Trust your instincts along the way. No one knows your baby like you do, and that connection will guide you through this process.

Okay, enough talk, let's get practical! In the next section, we'll explore gentle, research-backed strategies to help your little one (and you!) sleep better. We’ll cover everything from creating calming bedtime routines to understanding age-appropriate sleep expectations.

Remember, you are not alone on this journey. Parenting is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be bumps in the road, nights where sleep feels like a distant dream. But I promise you, with consistent effort and a sprinkle of self-compassion, peaceful nights are within reach. You’ve got this!

When to start your sleep plan

Okay, let's talk about getting your little one (and you!) sleeping better. And the first step is figuring out the when. When is the right time to actually start making changes? Whatever timeline you choose is perfect for your family. There's no rush—you'll know in your heart when you're ready to take this step. It's a big question, and timing is key. 

You're probably in a good spot to begin if you feel comfortable with the info we've covered so far, you've touched base with your child's doctor (always a good idea!), and your little one is around the five-month mark – that's often when they're developmentally ready for more consolidated sleep. Having a predictable schedule for the next few weeks helps too—no big trips or major shake-ups planned. But honestly, the most important thing is that you feel mentally and emotionally ready to commit to the process.

And here's a little secret: you don't need to have everything perfectly in place before you start. Still night feeding? Room-sharing? Baby still in a bassinet? Totally fine! This program is designed to meet you wherever you are in your parenting journey. We'll tackle all of that together. You're doing an amazing job navigating the complex world of parenthood. Even the fact that you're here, learning and growing, speaks volumes about your commitment as a mother.

Now, there are a few situations where it might make sense to hold off for a little bit. A trip coming up within the next month? Probably best to wait, since building healthy sleep habits takes a few weeks. Same goes for vaccinations—give it a couple of days after any shots. If your little one is feeling under the weather, let them fully recover first. And of course, any unresolved health concerns should be addressed with your pediatrician before we dive in. Big life changes like a move or starting daycare? Give your family a week or so to adjust to the new normal. And teething? If a tooth is about to break through, hanging tight for a day or two can make things easier.

Working parents, listen up! Starting on a Thursday can be a smart move. It gives you Friday at work, then the weekend to navigate those first few nights (which can be a bit more intense) before Monday rolls around. But truly, the best time to start is whenever it feels right for your family.

Got a supportive partner, family member, or friend? Amazing! Lean on them. That extra emotional support can be a game-changer. But to all the solo parents out there, know that I implemented this with my baby completely on my own. It was challenging, yes, but absolutely possible. You are stronger than you think.

Before we get rolling, let's do a little detective work. Grab the sleep tracker and note down your baby's sleep patterns for three days and nights – naps, feeds, bedtime, night wakings, the whole nine yards. Don’t change anything yet, just observe. This baseline information is gold.

Better sleep is coming. Trust your gut. You’ll know when you’re ready. That inner parenting wisdom is powerful.

Your journey to better sleep isn't just about following steps—it's about honoring your family's unique needs while caring for yourself too. You've got this, even when it feels challenging.

Environment 

Creating the Perfect Sleep Environment

A carefully designed sleep space sets the foundation for healthy sleep habits. Think of your baby's sleep environment as a sanctuary—a place that signals to their developing brain that it's time to rest and recharge. Imagine bedtime as the start of a carefully orchestrated journey—a time when your baby's day of play, exploration, and gentle learning builds up an internal sleep battery. The first step is designing a cozy sleep space that reinforces that natural build-up of sleep pressure.

Choose a calm, quiet corner in your home away from the hustle and bustle. The crib or bassinet should serve as the centerpiece, surrounded by soft, neutral colors and minimal décor that soothe the senses. This clutter-free area becomes a haven—a secure, inviting sanctuary where your little one feels safe and ready to transition from wakefulness to sleep.

When setting up the crib:

Use a firm mattress that fits snugly in the frame.

Cover it with only a tight-fitting sheet.

Keep the crib free of pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and bumpers.

Position the crib away from windows, cords, and heaters.

Ensure all furniture is secure and can't tip if grabbed.

Remember that your baby doesn't need fancy decorations or stimulating visuals in their sleep space. Simple, neutral colors and minimal décor create a soothing environment that promotes the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Trust your instincts here. You know your baby better than anyone, and the love you put into creating this space matters more than any trendy nursery decor.

You're already showing incredible dedication by focusing on creating this sanctuary for your little one—a testament to the loving parent you are.

Setting the Right Environment: Darkness, Sound, and Temperature

After setting up your baby's sleep area, adjust the room by focusing on three critical elements that help your baby fall asleep and stay asleep naturally.

Darkness
Darkness is key for good sleep. Lowering the lights with blackout curtains tells your baby's brain it’s time to relax and helps it make melatonin—the hormone that helps them sleep.
For the best results:

Install blackout curtains or shades that eliminate all outside light.

Cover any small LED lights from monitors, sound machines, or other devices.

Use the "hand test"—if you can see your hand in front of your face when the lights are off, the room isn't dark enough.

During nighttime check-ins, maintain soft, ambient lighting for necessary tasks such as feeds or diaper changes.

Sound
A consistent auditory backdrop is equally important. A gentle white noise machine or the subtle hum of a fan can smooth out any sudden sounds that might disrupt your baby's sleep.
For optimal sound conditions:

Use a white noise machine set to a steady, unvarying sound (white noise or rain are good options).

Place it away from the crib but close enough to be effective—about 3-6 feet away.

Keep the volume moderate—similar to a shower running (around 65-70 decibels).

Ensure it runs continuously rather than on a timer.

Consider a portable option for travel to maintain consistency.

Temperature
The room's temperature should be comfortably cool, ideally between 68°F and 72°F (20–22°C), to help regulate your baby's body temperature and promote a seamless descent into restful sleep.
Aim for:

Room temperature between 68-72°F (20-22°C).

Appropriate sleep clothing based on the room temperature (a general guideline is to dress your baby in one more layer than what you would wear to be comfortable).

A sleep sack or wearable blanket instead of loose blankets.

Proper air circulation with a fan if needed (pointed away from the baby).

Safety Essentials

A truly perfect sleep environment not only nurtures peaceful sleep but also prioritizes your baby's safety. Start with the crib—a secure sleeping area with a firm mattress that fits snugly, covered by a tight-fitting sheet. Ensure there are no loose blankets, pillows, or stuffed animals that could pose a risk.

Essential safety measures include:

Always placing your baby on their back to sleep.

Using a sleep surface specifically designed for infants.

Keeping the crib clear of all objects except for a fitted sheet.

Ensuring smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are functioning properly.

Positioning the crib away from windows, blinds, cords, and heaters.

Checking that all nursery furniture meets current safety standards and is properly secured.

Maintaining the crib's structural integrity by regularly checking for loose parts.

When you enter your baby's room for nighttime check-ins, take a moment to ensure these safety elements remain in place.

Creating Consistency

The true power of a well-designed sleep environment comes from consistency. When the same conditions are present night after night, your baby's brain learns to associate these specific environmental cues with sleep. This consistent sleep environment forms the backdrop for your bedtime routine, creating a seamless transition from day to night. As your baby grows, maintaining these core elements—even as other aspects of sleep might change—provides stability and security that supports healthy sleep development.

By thoughtfully crafting each element—from the inviting sleep space to the carefully controlled conditions and rigorous safety measures—you’re building a foundation for a consistent bedtime routine. This comprehensive approach not only helps your baby develop healthy sleep patterns but also transforms bedtime into a cherished ritual that nurtures growth, security, and family connection.

The Bedtime Sweet Spot
Are you exhausted? Running on fumes, hoping your little one will finally settle down for the night? You're not alone. Take a moment to acknowledge how much you've already done today—feeding, nurturing, and caring for your little one. That's no small feat when you're running on empty.

Sleep can feel like an unpredictable mystery when you have a baby, but infant sleep actually follows patterns that we can work with. Most babies learn to sleep longer stretches at night before they master daytime naps. That's why we start this journey with bedtime.

Think of your baby's sleep readiness like a battery that charges throughout the day. From the moment they wake from their last nap, this "sleep battery" starts filling. Feeding, playing, and even a bit of exploration add charge. By bedtime, when the sleep battery is just right, your baby should fall asleep easily within 5-20 minutes of being placed in their crib.

If the battery isn't charged enough (not enough wake time), your baby simply won't be tired enough to settle.

If it's overcharged (too much wake time), stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline flood their system, making it harder to relax into sleep.

Wake Windows: The Key to Perfect Sleep Pressure
The most reliable way to achieve that perfect sleep pressure is through appropriate wake windows—the amount of time your baby stays awake between sleeps.

Guidelines for age-appropriate wake windows before bedtime:

5 to 7 months: 2.5 to 3 hours.

7 to 10 months: 3 to 3.5 hours.

11 to 14 months: 3.5 to 4 hours.

14 months and older: 4 to 5 hours.

Remember, these are ranges, not exact prescriptions. Some babies need slightly more time, others slightly less. Watch your baby and adjust accordingly.

Research shows that most babies have a natural "sweet spot" for bedtime between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. This timing works with their biological rhythms and typically results in easier falling asleep, fewer night wakings, better quality sleep, and a more appropriate wake time in the morning. If your baby currently goes to bed later, gradually shift bedtime earlier until you reach that 7:00-8:00 p.m. window. 

To ensure your baby has the perfect amount of sleep pressure by bedtime, be mindful of when their last nap ends:

5 to 7 months: End between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m.

7 to 10 months: End between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m.

11 to 14 months: End between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m.

14 to 24 months: End between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m.

Sometimes you may need to gently wake your baby from their last nap to preserve this timing. Remember to be patient with yourself during this transition. Every small step toward better sleep is progress worth celebrating.

Creating Your Perfect Bedtime Routine

A steady bedtime routine tells your baby that it's time to sleep. It helps them switch from a busy day to a calm, sleepy night. Try to keep your routine 15–30 minutes long and do the same steps each night.

Simple Steps for a Bedtime Routine:

Start in a calm setting: Dim the lights, play some soft background sounds or white noise, and keep the room comfortably cool (about 68°F–72°F or 20°C–22°C).

Include these basics: A bath (if you like), a fresh diaper and comfy pajamas, a feeding (earlier in the routine, not at the end), a story or soft lullaby, and a sleep sack or proper sleepwear.

Finish with a gentle sign-off: Say a short goodnight phrase or do a small ritual, then put your baby in the crib while they're drowsy but still awake. This helps them learn to fall asleep on their own.

Sample Bedtime Routines:

Option One: Bath, lotion/massage, diaper and pajamas, feeding, sleep sack, book, song, goodnight phrase, and then into the crib awake.

Option Two: Quick wipe-down, diaper and pajamas, feeding, gentle play, sleep sack, book, goodnight phrase, and then into the crib awake.

The key is to do the same steps every night. This helps your baby learn that it's time to recharge their "sleep battery."

Teaching Independent Sleep Skills 

The importance of falling asleep independently

Helping your baby learn to fall asleep independently is one of the biggest steps toward restful nights. Tonight marks the beginning—your little one will start discovering how to drift off to sleep on their own. The familiar routines of rocking, bouncing, or feeding to sleep will be gently set aside. Instead, you’ll place your baby in their crib while they’re still awake.

For some of you, this idea might feel overwhelming—even impossible. Whatever emotions you're feeling right now—uncertainty, anxiety, or even guilt—they're all completely normal. Your concern simply shows how deeply you care about your baby's wellbeing. Maybe you’ve never seen your baby fall asleep without help. Others might be thinking, “My baby’s been doing this for months!” No matter where you’re starting from, tonight is a new chapter, and you’ll witness your baby taking an important step toward better sleep.

Here’s something most people don’t realize: nobody actually sleeps straight through the night—not you, not me, not your baby. Our bodies are designed to cycle through different stages of sleep, and at the end of each cycle, we experience a brief, natural awakening. This happens every hour or two, all night long.

Most of the time, we don’t even notice these awakenings. We instinctively check our surroundings, feel safe, and drift right back to sleep. But now, imagine you fell asleep in your own bed and woke up in your neighbor’s house. Would you simply roll over and go back to sleep? Probably not! You’d be startled, confused, maybe even scared. That’s exactly how a baby feels when they fall asleep in your arms but wake up alone in their crib.

If your baby depends on rocking, bouncing, or feeding to fall asleep, they’ll expect the same thing each time they wake during the night. They’ll stir, check their surroundings, and think, “Wait, where am I? Where’s Mom? I need her to help me fall back asleep.” This is why they call out for you—not because something is wrong, but because they don’t know how to settle back into sleep on their own.

This is why independent sleep at bedtime is so important. When your baby learns to fall asleep without external help, they’ll begin linking their sleep cycles seamlessly, sleeping longer stretches with fewer night wakings.

If your baby already does this—amazing! If not, don’t worry. You’re not behind, and you’re not alone. This program is here to guide both you and your baby through the process. The journey to better sleep isn't a race. Every family moves at their own pace, and your timeline is perfect for your unique situation.

Laying Your Baby Down Awake

Now it’s time for the next step—placing your baby in their crib while they’re still awake. Their eyes should be open, so they’re fully aware of where they are before falling asleep. If they use a pacifier, they can have it, but you won’t be replacing it if it falls out during the night.

You’ve done everything you can to prepare their little body for sleep. Now, it’s their turn.

Before stepping away, take a moment to connect. Tell your baby how much you love them. Reassure them that you’re always there. Give them a gentle hug, a soft kiss, and lay them down.

Night one has officially begun.

What Happens Next?

Your goal is to make it to 6 a.m. or later tomorrow morning. But you might be wondering, “What if my baby cries? What if they protest? How will we possibly make it until morning?”

Here’s the key: You are not abandoning your baby. You will be present throughout this journey, responding with love and reassurance while still allowing them the space to develop this new skill. You’ll meet every physical and emotional need, guiding them step by step.

This process isn’t just about sleep—it’s about building confidence, for both you and your baby. And I promise, you will get there. Keep following along—I’ll walk you through every step. 

Even when this feels challenging, remember that you're giving your baby the gift of healthy sleep habits that will benefit them for years to come. Your strength and consistency through this process is an act of profound love.

Understanding self-soothing behaviors

Self-soothing is an essential skill that helps your baby settle to sleep and transition between sleep cycles without relying on you. But let’s be clear—self-soothing doesn’t mean they won’t need comfort. It simply means they’re learning to relax and fall asleep in a way that feels natural and safe.

Some babies instinctively find ways to self-soothe, like sucking on their fingers, rubbing their face, or softly babbling. Others need more time and guidance. Either way, your baby is capable of learning this skill, and you’ll be there to support them.

To encourage self-soothing, start by pausing before intervening when your baby stirs. Sometimes they’re just adjusting between sleep cycles, and giving them a moment can help them learn to settle independently. A consistent sleep environment—a dark room, white noise, and a comfortable temperature—also creates a sense of security, making it easier for them to relax.

If your baby is used to falling asleep in your arms, gradually reduce your involvement. Try putting them down drowsy but awake, and instead of picking them up at the first fuss, offer gentle reassurance with a soft voice or a light touch. Over time, they’ll become more confident in settling on their own.

Most importantly, stay consistent. Babies learn through repetition, and predictable routines help them feel safe. Some nights will be easier than others, but with patience and practice, your baby will develop the ability to self-soothe—leading to longer, more restful sleep for both of you. 

The Comfort Check Method 

Timed Reassurance Visits

You've just placed your little one in their crib. Now, let's talk about what happens next. Many parents assume that babies should fall asleep instantly—head down, eyes closed, and off to dreamland. But that's not how sleep works for any of us.

Think about your own bedtime experience. You likely have a personal wind-down sequence—adjusting your pillow just right, finding that perfect position, pulling up the covers to your chin, taking a few calming breaths. These subtle rituals signal your body it's time for rest. Until now, your baby has depended entirely on you for their sleep transition—whether through gentle rocking, nursing, or rhythmic bouncing. Now comes the opportunity for them to discover their own pathway to sleep.

This transition can feel overwhelming for some parents. Remember that your anxiety about this process simply reflects how deeply you care. This depth of love is your greatest strength as you navigate these changes together. If you're someone who finds it particularly difficult to hear your baby's protests, please know you're not alone. Many parents struggle with this aspect of sleep learning, and your feelings are completely valid. This program offers flexibility to accommodate different comfort levels while still supporting your baby's growth.

Reading Your Baby's Response

When babies face new challenges, tears are their primary language. This isn't a sign of distress or pain—it's simply their way of communicating, "This feels unfamiliar, and I'm figuring out how to adapt." As their parent, you understand that sometimes necessary changes come with temporary discomfort.

What's truly fascinating is watching how your baby's response evolves throughout this process. Most babies follow what I call the intensity curve—a gradual but noticeable shift from initial protest to self-regulation. The remarkable thing about this curve is that it gives you visible markers of your baby's progress.

At first, you might hear powerful level-10 protests—the flushed cheeks, arched back variety that tugs hardest at your heart. But as you observe patiently, the intensity typically begins to decrease:

Level 10: Full-volume crying, physical tension

Level 7-8: Strong but slightly moderated protest

Level 5-6: Intermittent fussing with brief quiet moments

Level 3-4: Softer whimpers, longer pauses, body relaxing

Level 1-2: Gentle humming, self-soothing movements like finger-sucking or gentle head turns

Each step down this curve represents your baby actively working through their sleep process—discovering what feels comforting, what helps them transition, what brings them peace. This isn't just noise; it's your baby's way of developing crucial self-regulation skills.

For parents who find it especially challenging to hear crying, we can adjust the approach. Listen to your heart here—there's no single "right way" to do this. Your intuition about what your baby needs is an invaluable compass on this journey. Some families prefer more frequent check-ins with shorter intervals between visits. Others might choose to stay in the room, gradually increasing distance from the crib over several nights. The framework is adaptable to honor both your baby's learning needs and your emotional comfort.

Progressive Support Techniques

The Comfort Check Method centers on providing reassurance at strategic moments without disrupting your baby's developing skills. These brief, loving check-ins communicate your presence and support while giving your baby space to practice.

When entering for a comfort check:

Keep your energy calm and confident—babies are remarkably attuned to your emotional state

Use a soft, reassuring voice with simple phrases like "I'm here, you're safe, I love you"

Offer gentle touch—perhaps a hand on their chest or stroking their hair

Keep interactions brief (15-20 seconds) to avoid stimulation

Exit while your baby is still awake

For parents who need additional flexibility, consider these adaptations:

Staying in the room but gradually moving farther from the crib over several nights

Using a "touch-and-voice" approach for longer periods before transitioning to briefer check-ins

Implementing a "chair method" where you sit nearby, providing reassurance while your baby learns to fall asleep with you present

Extending comfort check time slightly if you notice it significantly helps your baby settle

When someone says, "Your baby cried for 25 minutes last night," our minds often picture non-stop distress. But understanding the intensity curve transforms this perception. Those 25 minutes likely included just a few minutes at high intensity, followed by a gradual decrease as your baby worked through their process. This perspective shift helps many parents navigate this transition with greater confidence.

Most importantly, remember that this journey isn't rigid—it's designed to be personalized. Your instincts matter here. If a particular approach feels too challenging, we can adjust. Some parents need to implement changes more gradually, and that's completely acceptable. The path might take slightly longer, but honoring your comfort level often leads to more consistent implementation and better long-term results.

As you embark on this journey, carry this gentle reminder: your baby is learning, not suffering. You are supporting their growth, not ignoring their needs. This temporary adjustment period paves the way for healthier sleep patterns that benefit your entire family for years to come. I'm here to guide you through each step, helping you tailor this approach to fit your unique family dynamics.

The Consistency Key 

Why consistency makes all the difference

When helping your baby learn to sleep through the night, consistency creates clarity. Give yourself grace on this journey. Even the most committed parents have moments of doubt or inconsistency. What matters is your overall dedication, not perfect execution. Think of sleep training like learning any new skill—the clearer the instructions, the faster the learning. Consistent responses help your baby understand what to expect, reducing confusion and shortening the adjustment period.

Many parents worry that consistency means rigidity, but that's not the case. Consistency simply means providing predictable responses that your baby can count on. Within that framework, there's plenty of room for personalization and flexibility based on your family's unique needs.

The key to success with the fewest tears isn't perfection—it's reliability. When your baby receives the same loving, predictable response night after night, they learn to trust the process. This trust forms the foundation for healthy sleep habits that can last a lifetime.

Managing challenging moments

The middle of the night brings unique challenges—especially when you're exhausted yourself. It's normal to question your approach when it's 3 AM and you're wondering if your baby is hungry or simply seeking comfort.

During these moments, remember that your responses are teaching your baby important lessons about sleep. When nighttime wakings consistently result in feedings, your baby learns that crying leads to feeding, regardless of hunger. This pattern can actually increase night wakings rather than reducing them.

For many families, the toughest challenge comes between 4-6 AM, when sleep naturally lightens and babies are most likely to wake. During these early morning hours, your commitment to your plan may be tested. Remember that this is often the final hurdle before consolidated sleep.

Those middle-of-the-night moments when you're questioning everything? They're part of every parent's experience. Your willingness to work through them shows remarkable strength.

If you're struggling, consider keeping a journal by your bed to record thoughts and feelings during nighttime wakings. This simple practice can help you maintain perspective during challenging moments and track your baby's progress over time.

Adapting without confusing

Flexibility doesn't mean changing your approach every night—it means creating a plan that respects both your baby's needs and your parenting philosophy. The goal is to adapt thoughtfully without sending mixed messages.

Some babies need a more gradual approach to night weaning. Others might be ready to reduce feedings more quickly. The key is to choose a pace that feels right for your family and then maintain consistency within that framework.

If you need to make adjustments to your plan, introduce changes intentionally and maintain them for at least 3-4 nights before making further modifications. This gives your baby time to adjust while still providing the consistency they need to learn.

Remember that adapting your plan doesn't mean abandoning it. Even gentle adjustments should maintain the fundamental message: nighttime is primarily for sleep, and daytime is for nourishment and play.

The SIP Method for Nighttime Nutrition 

Sleep-State Requirement: Ensure baby is fully asleep before feeding

When I sleep trained my own baby, I faced a significant challenge. Much of the advice I received suggested eliminating all night feedings immediately. My son was nursing hourly throughout the night, and I couldn't imagine how to remain consistent with sleep training while addressing what seemed like genuine hunger.

That's why I developed the SIP Method—a gentle, flexible approach to gradually shifting your baby's nutrition to daytime hours while supporting healthy sleep development. This method works whether your baby currently feeds once or multiple times throughout the night.

The first principle of the SIP Method is to feed your baby only when they're in a sleep state. Before offering any nighttime feeding, wait until your baby has been completely asleep for 5-10 minutes. This brief waiting period is crucial because it establishes an important message: when your baby wakes at night, the default response is returning to sleep, not immediately receiving food.

For many parents, this feels counterintuitive. Trust that you can honor both your baby's need for nutrition and their need for sleep skills. Finding this balance doesn't make you less responsive—it makes you a thoughtful parent who considers all aspects of your child's wellbeing. We're programmed to respond quickly to our babies' cries. However, this small adjustment helps break the wake-feed association that keeps many babies cycling through multiple night wakings.

This doesn't mean ignoring your baby when they wake. Instead, use your chosen comfort method (timed check-ins or your customized approach) to help them settle. Once they've been peacefully asleep for 5-10 minutes, you can proceed with the scheduled feeding.

Initiate Feedings on Schedule: Feed at predetermined times, not in response to waking

The second principle involves setting specific times for nighttime feedings rather than feeding in response to your baby's wakings. Based on your baby's age and needs, you'll establish a feeding schedule—perhaps one feeding around 1 AM for babies who are nearly ready to sleep through the night, or feedings at 10:30 PM and 3:30 AM for babies who genuinely need two nighttime feedings.

These times aren't arbitrary. The 10:30 PM feeding occurs when the sleep drive is naturally high, making it easier for your baby to return to sleep afterward. The 3:30 AM feeding happens just before the challenging 4-6 AM window when sleep naturally lightens.

If your baby happens to be awake at the scheduled feeding time, continue with your comfort method until they've been asleep for 5-10 minutes before offering the feeding. This ensures you're not inadvertently reinforcing the connection between waking and feeding.

This scheduled approach might feel mechanical at first, but it serves an important purpose: it helps your baby learn that feedings happen at consistent times, not whenever they wake and cry. This predictability helps reshape their expectations and gradually extends their sleep periods.

Portion Reduction: Gradually decrease amounts over several nights

The third principle involves gently reducing the amount offered during each nighttime feeding. For bottle-fed babies, this means decreasing the volume by 1-2 ounces each night. For breastfed babies, it means shortening nursing sessions by 2-5 minutes each night.

This gradual reduction allows your baby's body to adjust comfortably while encouraging increased daytime intake. By night five, most babies have successfully weaned off nighttime feedings entirely and are ready for consolidated sleep.

However, flexibility is essential here. Some babies benefit from a more gradual approach—perhaps reducing over 7-10 nights instead of five. Others may need to maintain one feeding longer term, especially if they're younger or have had weight gain concerns. The pace should reflect your baby's unique needs and your comfort level as a parent. You know your baby's cues and needs better than anyone. That intuitive connection is precious and will guide you in adapting these principles to fit your unique situation.

For babies who need three feedings spaced throughout the night or who need to maintain one consistent feeding, the SIP Method can be adapted accordingly. The principles remain the same, but the implementation is customized to support your baby's nutritional requirements.

Shifting nutrition to daytime hours

As nighttime feedings decrease, it's important to ensure your baby has ample opportunity to make up those calories during the day. This doesn't mean force-feeding or stressing about exact amounts—simply offer regular feedings based on hunger cues and be attentive to opportunities for extra nourishment.

For babies under 12 months, continue offering breast or bottle every 2.5-3.5 hours during the day. Some babies naturally shift to a four-hour schedule, which is perfectly fine as long as they're gaining appropriately.

For babies receiving solids, maintain a consistent mealtime routine. Remember that until one year of age, breast milk or formula remains the primary source of nutrition, with solids playing a complementary role.

Most importantly, trust your baby to regulate their own intake. As nighttime calories decrease, many babies naturally increase their daytime feeding. Your job is simply to provide regular opportunities for nourishment in a relaxed, responsive environment.

This transition to predominantly daytime feeding supports not only better sleep but also more engaged, pleasant daytime interactions. Babies who consolidate their nutrition during waking hours tend to be more alert for play and learning, creating a positive cycle that benefits the entire family.

Remember that this journey isn't about forcing your baby to conform to rigid expectations—it's about gently guiding them toward a healthy pattern that supports their growth and development while allowing everyone to get the rest they need.

As you navigate these changes, celebrate each small victory along the way. Every step forward—even the tiniest adjustment—represents your commitment to helping your family thrive. You're doing incredible work.

Moving Forward 

What progress really looks like

When you embarked on your sleep training journey, you may have imagined a perfect routine—your baby dozing off effortlessly, with naps and nighttime sleep that followed every textbook rule. In reality, progress isn’t about perfection; it’s about transformation and growth. Think about that baby who once needed endless rocking and soothing, now settling in just 15 minutes. Sure, some nights may still require an extra minute or two of comfort, but these small victories matter. Every night your baby sleeps a little longer, every morning they wake closer to the ideal time, and every moment of reduced stress during transitions is proof of real progress. You've shown incredible dedication getting to this point. The fact that you've persevered through challenging nights speaks volumes about your commitment as a parent—something your child will benefit from in countless ways beyond just sleep.

It’s important to remember that progress comes in waves. Some nights everything clicks into place, while others may bring disruptions from developmental leaps, teething, or growth spurts. This natural ebb and flow isn’t a setback—it’s a normal part of learning new sleep habits. True progress isn’t just about a sleep log full of numbers; it’s about the overall well-being of your family. Give yourself permission to celebrate how far you've come, even when it doesn't match your initial expectations. Your journey is unique and valuable exactly as it is. Ask yourself:

Are you feeling more rested and able to enjoy your day?

Do you notice that your baby is more engaged and responsive while awake?

Are moments of frustration becoming less frequent as your baby gains independence?

These observations highlight what progress truly means—your baby is developing self-soothing skills, and you’re rediscovering the joy of parenthood.

Handling setbacks with confidence

Even with a solid routine, occasional disruptions are inevitable. Growth spurts, teething discomfort, illness, or changes in daily routines (like travel or daycare) can all shake things up. When this happens, take a closer look at the details: Remember that these temporary disruptions don't erase all your hard work. Your patience during these challenging moments is building resilience—both yours and your baby's.

Identifying the Trigger

Look for any recent changes in your baby’s environment or schedule. Has their wake window shifted? Are they reaching a new developmental milestone—like rolling, crawling, or pulling up—that might be temporarily affecting their sleep? Even small changes, like a slight shift in room temperature or lighting, can make a difference.

Short-Term Adjustments

Instead of starting from scratch, take a few days to reset. If your baby is waking up too early because of a short nap, try keeping their usual wake windows and making the morning routine bright and energetic. Even if sleep seems disrupted for a few nights, remember—your baby’s sleep skills are still there, just waiting to be reactivated.

Reinforcing the Routine

When setbacks happen, return to the basics:

Stick to consistent wake windows.

Maintain a soothing bedtime routine.

Adjust nighttime feedings if needed.

For example, if your baby seems uncomfortable or has a full belly causing spit-up, consider shifting their feeding 20–25 minutes earlier to allow for better digestion.

Your Calm Presence Matters

How you handle setbacks influences how your baby responds to them. A calm, confident approach reassures your baby that these disruptions are just temporary. Even if they resist a little, greeting them warmly with a consistent “Good morning” at the usual time reinforces the idea that this is the natural transition from sleep to wakefulness.

Even on days when you don't feel confident, know that showing up consistently for your child is enough. Your presence, even when imperfect, provides the security they need to navigate these transitions.

Celebrating sleep success

Every milestone, no matter how small, is worth celebrating. You've done something truly remarkable—not just teaching your baby to sleep, but learning to trust yourself through this process. That growing confidence will serve you through every parenting challenge ahead.

Small Victories

Remember the first time your baby fell asleep without an extended crying spell? Or the morning they slept just 15 minutes longer? Or the day they woke up past their usual wake time? Recognize these moments with as much enthusiasm as you would for any other major milestone.

The Ripple Effect

Improved sleep doesn’t just benefit your baby—it impacts your whole family. A well-rested baby is more engaged and alert during the day. And for you, better sleep can mean more enjoyable playtime, deeper conversations with family, and a noticeable reduction in stress.

Documenting the Journey

Consider keeping a journal beyond just tracking sleep patterns. Record morning moods, instances of self-soothing, and how small adjustments—like tweaking feeding times or shifting nap schedules—affect your baby and yourself. Over time, these notes can provide valuable insights into what works best.

Life Beyond Sleep Training: Adapting and Growing

Sleep training isn’t a one-time fix—it lays the foundation for lifelong healthy sleep habits. Your baby’s sleep needs will continue to evolve as they grow. The wisdom you've gained about your child's unique needs during this process is invaluable. No book or course could ever replace your intuitive understanding of what works for your baby.

Adapting to Changing Needs

What works at six months might not be effective at nine months or beyond. Wake windows may change, naps might need adjustments, and transitions—like moving from three naps to two—may become necessary. Stay observant and flexible, adapting to your child’s needs.

Managing Family Dynamics

In households with multiple children, things can get a little more complex. While consistency remains key, you might need to adjust strategies—like staggering feeding times, setting up separate sleep spaces, or coordinating with caregivers. If room-sharing is necessary, spacing cribs apart and using white noise machines can help minimize disruptions.

Beyond the Nursery

The benefits of sleep training extend beyond bedtime. A well-rested family experiences smoother daytime routines, improved moods, and better overall health. Whether transitioning to a toddler bed, traveling, or facing other changes, maintaining familiar cues—like a consistent bedtime routine and familiar sleep aids—can help ease transitions.

The 70/30 Balance

Aim for consistency 70% of the time while allowing flexibility for special occasions like vacations or holidays. This balance helps maintain structure without making life feel overly rigid.

Moving Forward with Confidence

Sleep training is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Your baby’s sleep skills will continue to develop, supporting them (and you!) through each new stage of growth. Celebrate every win—whether it’s 10 extra minutes of uninterrupted sleep or a more peaceful morning—and embrace each challenge as an opportunity to fine-tune and reinforce healthy habits.

Trust the process. Trust the foundation you’ve built. And most importantly, trust yourself as a parent. Sleep is just one piece of the bigger picture—one that supports your family’s overall well-being, resilience, and joy. Through sleepless nights and challenging transitions, you've shown up with love and determination. That foundation of loving consistency is the greatest gift you could give your child—one that will support them far beyond these early years.

Understanding Naps

Begin Your Journey Here

Welcome to Mastering Naps. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to help your little one become a champion napper while giving you the confidence to navigate daily nap routines, transitions, and any regressions. Some of you may be joining after working on night sleep routines for a while, while others are in the process of learning new sleep strategies. Either approach works wonderfully, and I'm delighted you're here.

If you haven't explored these concepts before, I would spend time explaining the intensity curve—how babies' protests gradually decrease in intensity, moving from higher levels down to gentle, sleep-promoting behaviors. I would share research showing that crying associated with learning sleep skills has no negative long-term effects, and that babies aren't experiencing abandonment, but are simply adjusting to change. I would remind you how crucial it is to project calm confidence—like a flight attendant maintaining composure during turbulence, showing your baby that everything is perfectly fine. 

I would explain that consistency is the key to minimizing tears. Remember what happens with intermittent reinforcement? Like a casino that keeps us playing because we never know when we'll win, inconsistent responses keep your baby hoping that maybe this time, their protests will result in a different outcome. But you've watched all those videos and we've already covered these principles, so we don't need to revisit them. I just want to emphasize that these concepts remain vitally important.

You'll need to read your baby's cues carefully, trust that research supports this approach, check your own emotional state before entering the room, and maintain unwavering consistency. Like a reliable pattern that your baby can count on, you'll help them develop into a wonderful little napper.

Remember those essential principles we discussed in the night section—they apply equally to naps. If it's been a while since you reviewed that material, revisiting those sections of the Foundations of Sleep program would be a helpful refresher as you begin nap training. Now, let's delve into the world of naps. I'm excited for you to have a well-rested little one.

The Importance of Naps

Naps. What thoughts come to mind when you hear this word? Perhaps you envision a peaceful break to catch up on your favorite show, complete some work, or simply fold that waiting laundry. Or maybe you think, "Naps? What are those? I can barely lay my baby down." Whatever brings you here, you're in exactly the right place. Naps truly matter.

While naps certainly provide parents with valuable breathing room, they're absolutely essential for your baby's development. A significant portion of brain development occurs during sleep periods. Your baby's rapidly growing brain needs daytime sleep for proper growth and development. Without adequate naps, we inevitably end up with an irritable little one who melts down easily. Research indicates these babies often struggle with concentration, have shorter attention spans, and experience more tantrums.

Conversely, studies show that babies who nap well tend to be more content, more socially engaged, and easier to console. They also excel in language acquisition, memory formation, and other cognitive skills. Simply put, well-rested babies are happier and more capable of learning and interacting with the world around them. But there's more to consider.

Have you encountered the phrase "sleep begets sleep"? This means that better napping leads to better nighttime sleep. When babies nap well, they avoid becoming overtired. Preventing overtiredness makes bedtime transitions smoother and can reduce night wakings too. So whether you're currently struggling with naps, know they could be improved, or simply want guidance for approaching transitions and changes, this program will help you. Let's continue exploring the nuances of napping, because while vital, naps can sometimes present real challenges.

Why Naps Can Be Challenging

Hey there, parents—if you're feeling a bit frustrated with those unpredictable nap times, you’re not alone. Research tells us that none of us, not even adults, actually sleep uninterrupted through the night. Instead, we experience brief awakenings as part of our natural sleep cycles, and our little ones do the same. When babies hit that lighter phase of sleep, they often peek out at the world around them before drifting back off.

Now, imagine trying to do that during the day! While nighttime sleep comes with a cozy package—darkness, quiet, and a surge of melatonin—daytime naps have to contend with natural light, household sounds, and a busier environment. That’s why your baby might easily wake up from a nap after 40 to 50 minutes, even if they’re a solid sleeper at night.

And let’s be honest—life doesn’t hit the pause button during the day. Maybe there’s a sibling playing noisily down the hall, a doorbell ringing, or even a bit of construction outside. All these interruptions mean that naptime can be a bit of a balancing act between your baby’s natural sleep cycle and the everyday buzz of life.

Remember, while these challenges can seem overwhelming at times, they’re completely normal. With a little understanding and some gentle adjustments, you can help your baby find a more consistent nap rhythm. We're in this together, and I'm here to support you every step of the way as you navigate these daytime hurdles and turn them into opportunities for growth and rest.

Creating the Optimal Sleep Environment

Let's be honest—daytime sleep can feel like trying to convince a tiny human that missing out on the world's excitement for a few hours is a good idea. At night, you've got nature as your wingman—darkness falls, melatonin floods their little system, and their body naturally winds down. But during daylight hours? You're essentially working against your baby's natural "party time" programming. This is where creating a sleep sanctuary becomes your secret weapon for nap success. Let's walk through your baby's sleep space together—parent to sleep-deprived parent.

First, let's hunt for stimulation culprits. Those adorable toys dangling from the crib or that mesmerizing mobile spinning overhead? They're basically sending your baby the mixed message: "This is a fun place AND a sleep place!" (Did you know that babies under 5 months can't distinguish between playtime and sleep time contexts? Their developing brains are literally wired to get confused!) Time to remove these sleep saboteurs. The crib should scream "sleep" to your baby's senses, not "let's play!"

Now for the game-changer—light control. Light doesn't just make it harder to fall asleep; it actually suppresses melatonin production and keeps your baby's brain in active mode. Let's transform that room into a velvet-dark cocoon where sleep can truly take hold.

Try the "hand test" with me: Step into your baby's room during the day, close the door, kill the lights, and give your eyes a few minutes to adjust. Now, hold your hand up about six inches from your face. Can you see it? If you're nodding yes, your room is basically still hosting a baby rave. Time to get serious about darkness.

Cover every light source—yes, even that tiny blinking dot on the sound machine that somehow glows with the intensity of a thousand suns at 2 AM. Blackout your windows using whatever means necessary—specialized shades, curtains, or even the emergency blanket you've had in your car's trunk since 2019. Your goal is to create a space so wonderfully dark that the hand test fails spectacularly—no hand visible whatsoever. Extreme? Perhaps. But so is the zombie-like state you're operating in after weeks of fractured sleep.

And before you worry—babies aren't afraid of the dark. That fear doesn't develop until they're toddlers with active imaginations around age 2-3. Until then, darkness is actually your baby's comfort zone, reminiscent of their cozy womb days.

Temperature matters tremendously too. At night, our body temperature naturally dips, sending us a biological "time for sleep" signal. During the day, you'll need to manually create this effect. Think of your baby's room as a sleep cave—cool, comfortable, and inviting. If summer heat is working against you, get creative with a ceiling-directed fan, dress your little one in just a diaper or lightweight onesie under their sleep sack, or drop your home's temperature a degree or two during nap windows.

Now for your new best friend: the sound machine. Here's a mind-blowing fact—research shows babies fall asleep three times faster with appropriate white noise! It's not just about blocking your neighbor's dog barking or your delivery person's poorly-timed doorbell ring. That consistent sound actually helps your baby navigate the tricky waters between sleep cycles, potentially extending those precious naps. Choose steady white noise at shower-level volume, and for the love of all things peaceful, make sure it doesn't auto-shut off—nothing says "wake up!" quite like sudden silence.

Congratulations! Your baby's naptime oasis is now gloriously dark, soothingly cool, and wrapped in a comforting blanket of white noise—essentially the sleep equivalent of a five-star hotel for your little one. But wait, there's one crucial element remaining: safety.

Safe sleep practices aren't just a nighttime thing—they're a full-time commitment. The portable swing where your baby once took a legendary two-hour nap? The plush lounger that seemed so cozy? Save them for supervised awake time. For actual sleep, nothing beats a properly set up crib or play yard. Keep it minimalist—no pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, or anything that could compromise safety. (Trust me, there will be plenty of time for the 37 stuffed animals your relatives will inevitably gift your child.)

With these adjustments, you've created not just a room, but an environment that whispers "sleep" to every one of your baby's senses. Consider taking quick notes of what works best for your baby—because sleep deprivation and memory don't exactly go hand in hand.

Sweet dreams—for your baby, and hopefully soon, for you too!

The Path to Quality Naps

We've explored the importance of naps and acknowledged that they can sometimes be challenging. We've learned how to optimize the sleep environment. But what's the secret to achieving quality naps? While there's no magic trick, one factor makes an enormous difference: properly building sleep pressure. Remember, you're doing an amazing job navigating your baby's sleep journey. Even on difficult days, each step you take to understand your baby's sleep needs is a win for both of you.

The Sleep Battery

Think of your baby as having a "sleep battery" that gradually charges throughout wakeful periods. When your baby wakes in the morning, this sleep battery is completely depleted. Every activity throughout the day contributes to recharging it—from the morning feeding, to getting dressed, having breakfast, floor playtime, outdoor time, or emptying the laundry basket. Everything your baby does between morning wake-up and the first nap helps charge this sleep battery. The goal is to have the battery fully charged by nap time.

When the sleep battery reaches full capacity and your baby is placed in the crib, that accumulated sleep pressure helps them fall asleep easily and stay asleep for at least an hour. When they wake from this nap, the sleep battery is once again depleted, and the charging process begins anew. We aim to fully charge the sleep battery between each nap and before bedtime.

What happens when the sleep battery isn't adequately charged? If it's only partially charged, the sleep pressure isn't sufficient to facilitate easy falling asleep or to maintain sleep for a consolidated nap. The baby might struggle at nap time or wake after just 20-30 minutes. Conversely, if the sleep battery becomes overcharged—when a baby stays awake too long—stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline flood their system, making relaxation into sleep extraordinarily difficult. Overtired babies also struggle with falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Our objective is to achieve that perfect balance—a fully charged sleep battery without overcharging it.

Another Way to Visualize: The Sleep Hourglass

If the battery metaphor doesn't quite click for you, try visualizing your baby's sleep pressure as an hourglass. When your baby wakes up, their hourglass is empty. Throughout the wake period, sand steadily fills the upper chamber. Different activities contribute varying amounts of sand:

High-stimulation activities like outdoor time or new experiences add larger amounts

Quiet playtime adds moderate amounts

Passive activities like being in a stroller might add less

When it's time for a nap and the hourglass is perfectly full (but not overflowing), the sand can flow smoothly downward, creating a complete, restorative nap. But timing matters:

If you try to put baby down before enough sand has accumulated (too short wake window), there's simply not enough to flow through for a complete sleep cycle. The sand quickly runs out, resulting in a short catnap.

If you wait too long (too long wake window), the sand overflows the top chamber, causing some to spill outside the hourglass. This "spilled sand" represents those stress hormones that make it harder for the remaining sand to flow smoothly, disrupting both falling asleep and staying asleep.

Both metaphors illustrate the same principle: sleep pressure builds optimally within specific timeframes, and timing naps accordingly leads to better sleep quality.

Age-Appropriate Wake Windows

The time required to fully charge your baby's sleep battery (or fill their sleep hourglass) typically depends on their age. Younger babies need less time to build sufficient sleep pressure; as they grow older, that sleep battery expands, requiring longer to charge. Essentially, we build sleep pressure by maintaining appropriate wake windows—the time your baby spends awake between sleep periods. While we'll explore this concept more thoroughly later, here are general guidelines for age-appropriate wake windows:

Five to seven months: two to three hours

Seven to ten months: two and a half to three and a half hours

Eleven to fourteen months: three to four hours

Fourteen to twenty-four months: four to six hours

Remember, these are ranges, not exact prescriptions. Wake windows typically start when you remove your baby from the crib and end when you place them back in the crib for the next sleep period.

Beyond Sleepy Cues

If you've learned about sleepy cues from earlier guidance, you've likely observed signs like distant staring, yawning, eye-rubbing, and increased fussiness. During the newborn phase, these cues reliably indicated readiness for sleep. As babies grow, however, we need to balance these cues with appropriate timing. Consider this example: an 11-month-old typically needs a three-to-four-hour wake window, but at the two-and-a-half-hour mark, they begin yawning and rubbing their eyes. Despite these sleepy signals, their sleep battery isn't fully charged (or their hourglass isn't completely filled). Attempting a nap now would likely result in difficulty falling asleep or a shortened nap.

Instead of immediately responding to early sleepy cues, try changing your baby's environment or activity. Think about your own experience—yawning at 4:00 PM doesn't necessarily mean you need sleep; often you just need a change of activity. Babies are similar. Try moving to a different room, going outside, offering new toys, providing a snack, or playing music for a dance party. Just changing the stimulation often helps them push through initial drowsiness until their sleep battery is properly charged or their hourglass properly filled.

Watch Out for Mini-Sleeps

As you work to properly time naps, be vigilant about unplanned mini-sleeps. If your baby drifts off for ten minutes during a stroller walk or fifteen minutes in the car, this partially discharges the sleep battery (or lets some sand leak out of the hourglass), potentially undermining the upcoming scheduled nap. While not always preventable, try to keep your baby awake between planned naps. If an unintentional short sleep occurs, wake your baby promptly and extend the subsequent wake window by a corresponding amount to ensure the sleep battery fully recharges.

One final consideration involves what I call "drowsy feeding"—when babies become sleepy while nursing or taking a bottle. This momentary dozing or zoning out during feedings steals valuable sleep pressure from the sleep battery (or leaks sand from the hourglass), making the upcoming nap more challenging. Keep feedings bright and engaging to preserve that sleep pressure for actual nap time.

Remember that finding the right rhythm with your baby's sleep isn't about perfection—it's about progress. You'll have great nap days and challenging ones, and that's completely normal. Trust your growing understanding of your baby's unique sleep needs, and know that your consistent efforts to support healthy sleep habits are giving your child a wonderful gift that will benefit them for years to come.

Engaging Activities for Wake Time

To facilitate good naps, we must be intentional about how we use wake time between sleep periods. If you find yourself bored watching the clock and counting minutes until the next nap, your baby probably feels the same way—which won't lead to optimal sleep. What should you do during awake periods? While activities naturally vary based on your baby's age and development, consider focusing on these five essential elements:

Nutrition: Regardless of how your baby eats—breast, bottle, or solid foods—offer appropriate nourishment according to hunger cues approximately every two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half hours while your baby is fully alert.

Outdoor exposure: Take your baby outside when possible. While weather sometimes prevents this, outdoor time provides valuable benefits. Exposure to natural daylight, particularly in the afternoon, helps regulate melatonin production for better sleep later. If outdoor time isn't feasible, open curtains to let natural light stream in.

Connection: Give your baby your undivided attention, even briefly. Make eye contact, engage in conversation, and interact at their level. Include siblings in these interactions when appropriate—building with blocks together, creating blanket forts, making animal sounds, or simply giggling together. Even just five to fifteen minutes of focused face-to-face interaction stimulates brain development and meets emotional needs.

Physical movement: Allow your baby unrestricted floor time. Too often, babies move from car seat to stroller to carrier without opportunities for free movement. Like adults, babies sleep better when physically active during wake periods. Give them chances to practice developing skills—rolling, sitting, standing, crawling, walking, jumping, or running. Create space for physical exploration appropriate to their developmental stage.

Independent exploration: Permit your baby to investigate their environment without constant adult direction. While it may seem like you should continuously engage with your baby, independent exploration is crucial for developing problem-solving skills and building confidence and creativity. Allow them to play within eyesight while you attend to other tasks—unloading the dishwasher, reading a book, or simply taking a moment for yourself.

These elements shouldn't create stress or prevent you from accomplishing daily tasks. They're simply guideposts for wake time, and many can be combined. For instance, a blanket spread outdoors offers simultaneous opportunities for outdoor exposure, floor time, and face-to-face interaction. Implement these elements in any order and adapt them to fit your lifestyle.

Real life happens, and missing some elements during particular wake windows is perfectly acceptable. For example, if you need to run errands, don't stress about incorporating every element. You're likely addressing multiple needs simultaneously without realizing it—feeding before leaving home, experiencing fresh air while walking into the store, engaging in face-to-face interaction while discussing items in the shopping cart, and providing opportunity for independent exploration as your baby observes from the carrier or cart. This example successfully incorporates four of the five elements—aim to include the fifth (physical movement) during the next wake window.

Use these guidelines to create purposeful wake periods rather than passively watching the clock until the next nap. The ultimate goal of encouraging great naps is enabling your family to live life fully and joyfully.

Mastering Naps: Your Guide to Refreshing Days

The CALM Method

The CALM Method: Our Comprehensive Nap Training Approach

Hey there! Today I'm so excited to walk you through our CALM Method for nap training. I know firsthand how challenging nap time can be, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this journey.

Did you know that quality daytime sleep is absolutely foundational to your child's development? It's true! Research from Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine emphasizes that consistent, high-quality naps play a crucial role in cognitive development, emotional regulation, and memory consolidation in infants and young children. Sleep is essential for learning and brain development, with studies indicating that both nighttime and daytime sleep significantly impact a child's ability to retain information, process emotions, and regulate behavior. This isn't just theory - it's documented in Harvard Medicine Magazine!

I love sharing this research because it helps us remember why we're doing this important work. Additionally, Harvard research highlights that sleep stabilizes and strengthens newly formed memories, which is essential for infants who are constantly learning new skills. Harvard's Division of Sleep Medicine explains that memory consolidation occurs during specific sleep cycles, and disruptions in sleep—whether at night or during naps—can hinder this process. Those naps aren't just giving you a break (though that's important too!) - they're actually helping your baby process and retain all the new information they're learning every day.

So whenever nap time approaches, I want you to remember to stay calm. That's actually what our method is all about! Whether your baby is five months or two years old, these principles work. The CALM Method has four essential components that contribute to successful naps: Consistency, Awake Placement, Loving Support, and Measured Timing.

C Stands for Consistency

Let's talk about consistency first. Before each nap, you'll want to establish a brief, consistent routine that signals to your baby that it's sleep time. Think of this as a mini version of your bedtime routine - just 3 to 10 minutes is perfect!

What might this look like? You might finish up playing, then calmly walk to the nursery. Change that diaper if needed, get your baby into comfortable sleep clothes, turn on the sound machine, and dim those lights. Nothing complicated - just a simple sequence that helps your baby's brain recognize "Oh, it's time to wind down now."

If your baby needs feeding before nap time, try to keep that environment bright and engaging. This way you're not accidentally triggering sleep before you've even started your nap routine. Once the feeding is done, then you can transition right into your streamlined nap routine.

Trust me on this consistency piece - it makes such a difference! Your baby's brain is looking for these predictable patterns, and you're giving them exactly what they need.

A Stands for Awake Placement

Now here's the part that surprises many parents. After your consistent routine, I want you to place your baby in the crib with their eyes open—fully awake. I know! It seems counterintuitive, right? But this is actually a crucial step in developing healthy sleep associations.

When your baby enters the crib with open eyes and learns to settle independently into sleep, you're helping them develop a skill they'll use for years to come. Think of it this way - when you've built up the right amount of sleep pressure through an age-appropriate wake window and that soothing routine, your baby has both the readiness and the biological drive to fall asleep naturally.

This independent transition to sleep is really the foundation for those consolidated, restorative naps that we all dream about. And Harvard research actually connects these quality naps to enhanced memory retention and learning. You're not just helping them sleep - you're supporting their development in profound ways.

L Stands for Loving Support

Supporting your baby means being present and responsive—but in a measured way that encourages their developing independence. After placing your baby in the crib, go ahead and leave the room to give them space to practice self-settling.

Now, if some protests begin, please know that's completely normal! This adjustment period is expected, and I want to reassure you that you're not doing anything wrong. Our method offers you flexible support options depending on what feels right for your family:

First, there's the Two-by-Two Approach: You can visit your baby up to twice during a nap. Just limit each visit to a maximum of two minutes, where you provide gentle reassurance through soft words, a light touch, or gentle patting.

Or you might prefer the 15-by-15 Approach: For a more gradual intervention, check on your baby briefly—about 15 seconds every 15 minutes—as needed.

The goal here is to help your baby develop those self-soothing capabilities. Trust your intuition about what helps your specific baby. If those brief check-ins seem calming, keep doing them! If they seem to upset your baby more, maybe try allowing more independent time.

Remember, you know your baby better than anyone. The method is flexible, and consistency is really the key to success. I promise you, over time, your baby will learn to settle without needing your constant intervention. I've seen it happen hundreds of times with families just like yours.

M Stands for Measured Timing

Establishing clear time boundaries for each nap creates the structure and predictability that babies thrive on. Once you place your baby in the crib, allow up to 70 minutes for them to fall asleep. I know that might sound like a long time, but this extended window accommodates the natural building of sleep pressure and connection of sleep cycles.

If your baby hasn't fallen asleep within this timeframe, just go back in, gently let them know that nap time has concluded, and transition to awake activities with a positive attitude. No drama, no stress - just matter-of-fact and moving on with your day.

What about those short naps? If your baby takes a short nap (45 minutes or less), wait an additional 15 to 25 minutes before going in. They might surprise you and connect to another sleep cycle all on their own! If they don't, gently end the nap and resume your day. This structured approach helps your baby learn the difference between sleep time and play time.

Personalizing Your Approach

I want you to know that every family has unique needs and preferences. If leaving your baby's room feels too challenging at first, please adapt the approach to suit your comfort level. You might start by sitting nearby in the room and offering gentle support, then gradually increase your distance until you're comfortable stepping outside.

Throughout this process, please remember that your consistency is creating lasting benefits, even when it doesn't feel like it in the moment. So many parents I work with experience doubt during those first few days. That's completely normal! But I've seen those same doubts transform into confidence as they watch their baby's sleep skills develop.

The initial effort you invest now builds toward more restful days for your entire family. Trust your instincts and celebrate those small improvements - they're meaningful victories! Every baby who learns to nap well started with one successful nap. Then another. Then another.

The CALM Method is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to select the support level that works for your family and parenting style. The essential elements are consistency, patience, and trusting yourself. Finding the right balance might take several days or even a week of adjustment, but I promise you - the resulting improvements in sleep quality make every effort worthwhile.

Common Challenges

Let's talk about some challenges you might face, because I want you to feel prepared. If your baby becomes increasingly upset during settling time, try shortening the wake window by 10-15 minutes for the next nap. Sometimes we just need to fine-tune that timing.

For babies who initially settle but wake frequently, slightly extending your brief check-ins might help reinforce those developing self-soothing skills. Also check those environmental factors - is the room temperature comfortable (68-72°F is ideal)? Is the sound machine at the right volume?

Remember that occasional disruptions during developmental milestones, teething, or mild illness are completely normal. When these temporary challenges resolve, simply return to your consistent approach. Your baby hasn't forgotten how to nap - they're just working through something temporary.

By staying patient and committed to the CALM Method, you're setting the foundation for healthy, high-quality sleep patterns that will benefit your child for years to come. And I'm here with you every step of the way! You've got this, and I believe in you completely.

Age-Specific Guidance

Meeting Your Baby Where They Are

I firmly believe in meeting babies where they are developmentally and building from that foundation. Your baby's unique timeline is perfect for them, and recognizing that is the first step to success.

As you explore the following sections, you'll notice they're organized by age ranges, some of which overlap—for instance, five to seven months and seven to ten months. These sections correspond to the recommended number of naps for specific developmental stages. However, it's important to understand that while infant development follows predictable patterns, babies are wonderfully unique individuals.

For example, my own child transitioned to one nap at 13 months, while I've worked with families whose babies continued taking two solid naps until around 17 months. In the first case, I would reference the one-nap section despite my baby being younger than the typical age range, while in the latter case, the family would benefit from the two-nap guidance even though their baby was older than the suggested range.

If you're trying to decide between two sections, I encourage you to review both and make the best choice for your unique baby. Trust your instincts—you know your baby better than anyone else. There's no wrong approach—the goal is simply to meet your baby where they are developmentally right now.

For families who are simultaneously addressing nighttime sleep and naps, you might find your baby can tolerate longer wake windows than previously anticipated, now that they're experiencing more consolidated night sleep.

Your baby may surprise you with their adaptability, so keep an open mind as you implement these recommendations. Every small step forward is worth celebrating! And remember, if you need assistance with nap transitions, you'll find dedicated guidance for those situations later in the program. Now, let's begin by identifying your baby's age and current number of daily naps.

5-7 Months (3 Naps): Goals and Typical Routines

Welcome, parents of five- to seven-month-olds. You're at an exciting stage where sleep patterns can really begin to take shape! The following guidance is tailored specifically for you and your baby at this developmental stage. Let's begin by discussing your little one's daily schedule. Our guiding principle is "flexible routine, not rigid schedule."

Why is this distinction important? Many parents understandably desire a predictable schedule for their baby. I certainly relate to this—I personally thrive on structure and order. And yes, your baby similarly benefits from predictability and routine. But this mantra reminds us that your baby is a baby—not a robot, a human—not a clock. Give yourself permission to flow with your baby's needs while maintaining a general framework.

While I'll help you establish a schedule, it's really about creating a framework that sets your days up for success while allowing you to live life fully. Let's explore how to do this.

When developing your daily routine, I recommend four key goals that will position your baby for optimal sleep. First, aim for wake windows between two and three hours. Remember, your baby needs to build sufficient sleep pressure for quality naps, and these two- to three-hour wake windows will accomplish that.

Let me illustrate how these wake windows typically unfold throughout the day. Your baby wakes in the morning, and approximately two to two and a half hours later, takes their first nap. About two and a half hours after the end of nap one comes nap two. Roughly two and a half hours following the end of nap two is nap three. Finally, two and a half to three hours after nap three concludes, bedtime arrives.

Notice several important patterns: Wake windows generally range from two to three hours throughout the day. These intervals start on the shorter end of our target range and gradually lengthen as the day progresses. We begin with two to two and a half hours, increase slightly midday, and end with two and a half to three hours before bedtime.

Also, understand that I'm addressing parents of babies ranging from five to seven months. As babies grow, they typically need the longer end of the wake window range to build adequate sleep pressure. For instance, a five-month-old might manage just two hours for the first wake window, while a seven-month-old will likely need closer to two and a half hours.

These are ranges, not exact prescriptions. You're becoming more expert in your baby's sleep patterns with each passing day—trust what you observe. Remember that as they grow, you'll often need to extend toward the longer end of these ranges.

Before continuing, I want to acknowledge that some of you already have wake windows within or close to these targets. That's wonderful progress! Your consistency is already paying off. Others might be thinking, "My baby can barely stay awake beyond 90 minutes!" I understand that concern, but these truly are the appropriate wake window targets for this age. If you're not there yet, we'll work on gradually, gently extending your baby's awake time—aim for just 5-15 additional minutes per wake window. Every small extension is a victory worth celebrating!

When you notice sleepy cues emerging, change the environment or introduce your baby's favorite activity. Perhaps they love their play mat—place them there. Maybe they enjoy exploring kitchen cupboards—let them empty cups from the lower cabinet. If they enjoy walks, place them on your hip and stroll to a neighbor's house and back. For babies who love bath time, run some water. The goal is extending wakefulness just slightly longer to reach these target wake windows for optimal naps and night sleep.

Remember that wake windows start when you remove your baby from the crib and end when you place them back in the crib. Now, let's move to our second goal.

Nap time begins when you place your baby in the crib and ends when you remove them. At this age, no single nap should exceed two hours. You might wonder, "You want me to limit nap length and wake my baby?" If the nap reaches two hours, then yes—and here's why.

Excessively long naps can interfere with daytime feeding schedules, prevent adequate awake time between naps, and delay bedtime—all factors that can increase night wakings. When your baby reaches the two-hour mark during a nap, gently wake them. Enter the room, open the door, turn off the sound machine, draw the curtains, and begin speaking in a low, soothing voice. As those eyes open, bring your baby into a well-lit area to begin the next wake window.

If your baby's naps nowhere near reach this two-hour mark, don't worry. Short naps don't mean you're doing anything wrong—many babies take time to consolidate their sleep. Nap duration varies between babies, and this program will help you establish good, consolidated naps. I'll reiterate: please don't allow any individual nap to exceed two hours.

Our third goal addresses total daily sleep: we aim not to exceed four hours of total daytime sleep. This means distributing those four hours across three naps, which implies that your first two naps can't both last two hours each. As previously discussed, you might occasionally need to wake your baby to prevent exceeding four total hours of daytime sleep.

Why is this important? Your baby needs active awake time during the day. Finding this balance isn't always easy, but you're doing the important work of helping your baby develop healthy sleep patterns. Excessive daytime sleep can reduce nighttime sleep duration, which ideally should be 10-12 hours of consolidated, restorative sleep. We need to balance active awake time, quality naps, and consistent daytime feedings to achieve optimal night sleep.

At this age, we target approximately three to four hours of total daytime sleep complemented by 10-12 hours of night sleep. Some babies function best at the higher end of this range (3.5-4 hours), while others require the lower end (closer to 3 hours) to maintain adequate night sleep. You'll discover your baby's unique needs as you implement these guidelines—each day brings new insights. You'll discover what works best for your unique baby, and it may vary slightly day to day. Just maintain that four-hour maximum limit.

If your baby currently gets nowhere near three to four hours of total daytime sleep, don't worry—that's precisely why you're following this program. With your loving consistency, you'll see positive changes. After implementation, we expect to achieve about three to four hours of total daytime sleep, while still respecting the four-hour daily maximum.

Our fourth and final goal prioritizes protecting night sleep. Research indicates that babies generally thrive with bedtimes between 6:30 and 8:00 PM. I personally found 7:00-7:30 PM ideal for my children. To support this optimal bedtime range while ensuring a full wake window before sleep, we must be mindful of when the day's final nap ends.

Remember that bedtime typically varies within a range depending on how naps unfolded that particular day. Here's a simple guideline: to maintain a full wake window and target a 7:00-8:00 PM bedtime, your baby should wake from their final nap between 4:30 and 5:30 PM each evening.

Let's summarize our four routine goals: Wake windows range from two to three hours. No single nap exceeds two hours. Total napping hours are capped at four hours maximum. The final nap of the day ends between 4:30 and 5:30 PM.

Each morning, you'll start your day and follow this general framework. While specific timing will vary slightly depending on nap lengths, these goals balance the structure and predictability your baby needs while giving you flexibility to manage real-life circumstances. Remember that flexibility is key—some days will go according to plan, and others won't. Both are completely normal. Remember, these are examples of possibilities on any given day, not rigid schedules to follow precisely.

Making Decisions for Your Family

Let me begin with an important truth: there's no better parent for your baby than you. Nobody knows your baby like you do, and nobody could provide better care. Trust your intuition—it's one of your greatest parenting tools. In this section, I'll present some decisions for your consideration. Don't worry—I'll equip you with the tools needed to make the best choices for your baby and your family.

Formal nap training using the CALM. Method involves establishing consistency, ensuring awake placement, providing loving support, and implementing measured timing. Be sure to review those videos for complete understanding. But perhaps you're wondering, "Is formal nap training really necessary right now?" That's entirely your decision. If your current approach is working well, there's no obligation to change it.

If you can quickly help your baby settle to sleep, place them in the crib, and they consistently nap longer than an hour, you might choose to continue your present method. If your baby naps while being held and you enjoy this arrangement, and it's providing at least three hours of daytime sleep plus good night sleep, there's no reason to change. Honor what works for your family—there's no one-size-fits-all approach to baby sleep. If you're satisfied with your current situation and it's safe, who am I to suggest alterations? Continue what works.

You can still use this program to understand nap science, establish flexible daily routines, navigate transitions, and reference specific guidance if challenges arise. But how might you know when to consider formal nap training? Simply put, if your current approach isn't working optimally, it might be time for change. Here are some indicators that could suggest formal nap training would be beneficial:

You have established solid nighttime sleep and want to improve naps.

You previously had consistent night sleep but now experience night wakings or early morning wakings.

Putting your baby down for naps or achieving consolidated nap periods is becoming increasingly challenging.

Your baby only naps while being held, interfering with your family's overall well-being.

You intuitively feel ready to establish a solid nap foundation.

You're simultaneously addressing nighttime sleep and want to implement a comprehensive approach.

If any of these scenarios resonate with your situation, now might be the perfect time to begin formal nap training. Taking this step shows incredible commitment to your baby's development—be proud of yourself for making this choice. To achieve optimal results, plan to be home for most naps during the initial 15 days—approximately 70% of naps should occur at home during this period. Ask yourself: Do I recognize signs that formal nap training would be beneficial? Can I commit to having 70% or more of naps at home for the next 15 days? If you answer yes to both questions, it's time to begin nap training.

Don't approach this with apprehension—approach it with excitement. Your baby is capable of developing these skills, and you're providing the loving guidance they need to learn. Your baby is capable of developing these skills, and life beyond inconsistent naps will be transformative for your entire family.

If you are implementing formal nap training, I recommend focusing primarily on the first two naps. The third nap requires some additional decisions. Some families find that this third nap occurs in the crib similarly to the first two naps. For others, this final nap of the day proves more challenging. I often referred to this late-afternoon nap as "the bridge nap" because it simply helps many babies bridge the gap to bedtime.

Your baby might handle this nap beautifully in the crib. Try this approach for several days and then determine what works best for your baby. You might discover that crib napping works perfectly for all three naps. But if this third nap proves difficult, don't assume you're doing something wrong. Remember that challenges aren't failures—they're opportunities to adjust your approach for your unique baby. The challenge is developmental. Research indicates that naps typically consolidate sequentially—the first nap usually establishes consistency first, followed by the second nap, and finally, the third nap.

If the third nap proves challenging, do whatever safely helps your baby get this sleep—carrying in a baby carrier, snuggling, taking a stroller walk, or letting them join you on daily outings. This approach isn't a failure and won't confuse your baby. Being flexible with this third nap shows your responsiveness to your baby's needs. Rather, it meets your baby where they are developmentally while allowing time for maturation.

Also remember that this third nap is typically shorter—often just 30-45 minutes. If it's brief, that's entirely appropriate, especially if the day's earlier naps lasted longer than an hour. This final nap simply helps your baby comfortably reach bedtime without becoming overtired. When this nap occurs in the crib and lasts less than 45 minutes, you don't necessarily need to give your baby additional time to return to sleep.

So I pose this question: Will your baby's third nap happen in the crib or while being carried, snuggled, in a stroller, or on the go? Time will reveal the answer. Trust yourself to discover what works best for your unique situation. Try different approaches and let your baby guide your decision. There's no single correct solution.

You face one more important decision: Will you obsess over schedule precision or trust that infant development unfolds naturally? Perfectionistic parents (and I include myself in this category) tend to fixate on exact scheduling. How do I know this? Because I've been there—constantly striving to be the ideal parent. Perfectionism is my default response.

But research tells us something important about infant sleep development: While naps begin consolidating around five months, both nap duration and timing remain variable until approximately eight months. This doesn't mean your baby can't establish good nap patterns earlier. It simply means you might experience significant day-to-day variation—perhaps a one-hour nap on Monday becomes a two-hour nap on Tuesday.

These fluctuations can drive detail-oriented parents to analyze every aspect of the day, trying to identify exactly what created the "perfect" two-hour nap. The reality? While wake windows, activities, and our four goals matter, sometimes the explanation is simply normal developmental variability. Similarly, nap timing will fluctuate—your baby's second nap might begin at noon one day and 1:00 PM the next. Nap timing varies because nap duration varies. For parents attempting to plan their days precisely, this natural inconsistency can feel frustrating.

The choice is yours: Will you allow these normal variations to diminish your joy, or will you accept them as part of healthy development? I encourage you to embrace the natural ebb and flow of your baby's sleep journey. This mindset will bring much more peace to your days. I hope you choose the latter. Please don't let these fluctuations upset you—they're simply not worth the emotional energy. Your baby will become a wonderful napper. We just need your flexibility while your baby progresses through important developmental stages.

In summary: If your current approach works well, there's no need to change. But if you're ready for formal nap training, embrace it with optimism—the results will be transformative. You're laying the foundation for sleep habits that will benefit your child for years to come. Implement the third nap in whatever way best suits your baby, whether in the crib or through assisted methods. Finally, avoid obsessing over schedule precision and instead trust the natural progression of infant development. Meet your baby exactly where they are developmentally and build forward from there. Perfectionism only diminishes your enjoyment of this precious time.

Nap Training Specifics for Your 5-7 Month Old

Now let's discuss the specific nap training elements for your baby at this five- to seven-month stage. First, remember that you'll be following the CALM. Method as your foundation. Please review those videos thoroughly before proceeding, as we'll build upon those principles here. Let's explore the detailed recommendations tailored specifically for your baby at this age.

For the first two naps of the day, when your baby naps for 45 minutes or less, we want to provide an opportunity for them to return to sleep naturally. As we've discussed, babies transition through sleep cycles and often experience light sleep stages between cycles, sometimes briefly awakening. Giving them a short period to resettle enables them to connect sleep cycles for a more consolidated, restorative nap. For this particular age range, I recommend a slight modification to our standard approach.

In the Measured Timing component of the CAL Method, I generally suggest allowing 15-25 minutes for babies to fall back asleep after a short nap. However, for 5-7 month olds specifically, let's adjust this timeframe. When your baby takes a nap lasting 45 minutes or less, provide 10-15 minutes of uninterrupted opportunity to return to sleep without entering the room. This adjustment honors your baby's developmental stage while still encouraging sleep skill building. This shorter window offers sufficient opportunity without overwhelming your baby's developing sleep abilities. While briefer than our standard recommendation, it's developmentally appropriate for this age. If your baby successfully returns to sleep, that's wonderful—connecting sleep cycles is an advanced skill that deserves celebration.

Remember to adhere to our maximum nap duration guideline: no single nap should exceed two hours. Calculate this two-hour period from the moment you initially place your baby in the crib, without subtracting any time they spent returning to sleep mid-nap. For example, if you place your baby in the crib at 9:00 a.m., they take 20 minutes to fall asleep initially, then wake after 30 minutes of sleep, and take 10 minutes to return to sleep—you would still wake them at 11:00 a.m. if they're still sleeping, because that marks two hours from when they first entered the crib. Maintaining this two-hour maximum supports our overall sleep balance goals.

What if your baby doesn't return to sleep? If after the 10-15 minute window your baby remains awake, enter the room calmly, turn on the light, switch off the sound machine, and clearly state, "Nap time is over." Offer positive reinforcement—give them a hug and kiss, express how proud you are of their effort, then bring them into a bright, well-lit living area. This transition moment begins their next wake window.

I need to emphasize a crucial principle: Even following short naps, maintain your target wake window range. Consistency is key to helping your baby develop predictable sleep patterns—you're doing important work here. Allowing abbreviated wake periods after short naps reinforces an unproductive cycle of brief naps followed by brief awakeness. While your baby may appear sleepier than usual after a short nap, resist the temptation to accelerate the next nap. Instead, ensure stimulating, engaging awake time by intentionally incorporating nutritious feeding, fresh air exposure, interactive connection, physical movement opportunities, and independent exploration. Observe your baby carefully and make minor adjustments within the recommended wake window range. For instance, you might schedule the next nap at two hours and fifteen minutes rather than the full two and a half hours—make small adaptations based on your observations.

I understand that persistent short naps can feel disheartening, but view them as a normal part of the developmental process. Every baby develops at their own pace, and your consistent, loving guidance is exactly what they need. Maintain consistency, verify all environmental elements (ensuring the room is sufficiently dark and that your baby enters the crib fully awake), and eliminate any factors that might prematurely reduce sleep pressure, such as drowsy feeding sessions. With patience and persistence, those longer, consolidated naps will develop.

Each new day brings a fresh opportunity to practice and build these important sleep skills. Your consistency and patience are creating a foundation for healthy sleep habits that will benefit your child long-term.

Rest assured that prolonged refusal of multiple nap attempts is uncommon. Maintain consistency, follow this approach, and trust that nap refusals will soon resolve with patience and persistence. You're doing an amazing job navigating this journey—your dedication to your baby's sleep health truly shows what a wonderful parent you are.

7-10 Months (2 Naps)

Goals and Typical Routines

Welcome, parents of 7- to 10-month-olds. The following guidance is specifically crafted for you and your baby at this developmental stage. If this is your first exposure to the age-specific content, you've chosen a perfect time to begin working on nap improvement. If you previously explored the 5-7 month section, you'll notice familiar concepts here. While infant sleep follows consistent patterns across development, we'll focus on adjusting specific elements to match your baby's current developmental needs.

Let's begin with your baby's daily schedule. Remember our foundational principle: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Say it with me—flexible routine, not rigid schedule. This distinction matters because many parents naturally desire predictable structure for their baby. While your little one certainly benefits from consistency and pattern, this mantra reminds us that we're working with a developing human being, not a programmable device. I'll help you establish an effective schedule, but the ultimate goal is creating a framework that sets your days up for success while allowing space for real life to unfold.

When developing your baby's daily routine, I recommend four key objectives that will promote optimal sleep. First, aim for wake windows between two and a half and three and a half hours. Remember, your baby needs to build sufficient sleep pressure—to fully charge their sleep battery—for quality naps. These two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half-hour wake windows accomplish exactly that.

Let me illustrate how these intervals typically unfold throughout the day according to what I call the master plan. Your baby wakes in the morning, and approximately two and a half to three hours later, takes their first nap. About three hours after the conclusion of the first nap comes the second nap. Finally, three to three and a half hours after the second nap ends, bedtime arrives.

Notice several important patterns in this framework: Wake windows generally range from two and a half to three and a half hours throughout the day. These intervals start at the shorter end of our target range and gradually lengthen as the day progresses. We begin with two and a half to three hours, increase slightly by midday, and end with three to three and a half hours before bedtime.

It's important to note that I'm addressing parents of babies ranging from newly transitioned seven-month-olds to more mature ten-month-olds. As babies grow, they typically require longer wake windows to build adequate sleep pressure. For instance, a seven-month-old might only need two and a half hours for the morning wake window, while a ten-month-old will likely require closer to three hours for the same window. Remember these are ranges—observe your baby's responses and adjust accordingly. As your baby develops, you'll generally need to extend toward the longer end of these ranges.

Before exploring further, I should acknowledge that some families already have wake windows within or close to these targets. For others, you might be thinking, "My baby can barely stay awake two hours!" I completely understand this concern, but I want to reassure you that these truly are the appropriate wake window targets for babies taking two naps at this developmental stage.

If your baby isn't quite reaching these windows yet, we'll work on gradually extending their awake time—aim for just 5-15 additional minutes per wake window. When sleepy cues emerge, change the environment or introduce engaging activities your baby enjoys. If your baby loves practicing walking while holding your fingers, encourage this mobility. If they enjoy exploring household items like emptying the laundry basket, create opportunities for this discovery. For babies who appreciate outdoor stimulation, carry them on your hip for a short neighborhood walk to experience fresh air and natural sensory input. Bath-loving babies might enjoy water play to extend alertness. The objective is gently extending wakefulness to achieve these target wake windows for optimal naps and night sleep.

Remember that wake windows start when you remove your baby from the crib and end when you place them back in the crib. For parents who previously reviewed the five-to-seven-month section, you'll notice the following goals remain conceptually similar but with timing adjustments specifically calibrated for your baby's current developmental stage.

Our second goal addresses nap duration. Nap time begins when you place your baby in the crib and ends when you remove them. At this developmental stage, no single nap should exceed two hours. You might wonder, "Should I really limit nap length and wake my baby?" If a nap reaches the two-hour mark, then yes—and here's why.

Extended naps can interfere with daytime feeding schedules, reduce total awake time needed for development, and delay bedtime—all factors that can increase night wakings. When your baby's nap reaches the two-hour mark, gently wake them by opening the door, turning off the sound machine, drawing the curtains, and speaking in a low, soothing voice. As they wake naturally, bring them into a well-lit space to begin the next wake window. If your baby rarely naps close to this two-hour limit, don't worry. Nap duration varies between babies, and this program will help establish better consolidated sleep periods. I'll reiterate this important guideline: no individual nap should exceed two hours.

Our third goal addresses total daily nap duration: we recommend not exceeding three and a half hours of total daytime sleep. This means you'll distribute those hours across two naps, which means both naps can't simultaneously reach the two-hour maximum. Reference the sample schedules in your downloadable resources for visual examples of how to arrange these sleep periods effectively. Occasionally, you might need to wake your baby to prevent exceeding three and a half total hours of daytime sleep.

Why is this important? Your growing baby needs substantial active awake time for development. Excessive daytime sleep can reduce nighttime sleep duration, which ideally should be 10-12 hours of consolidated, restorative sleep. Balance between active awake time, quality naps, and consistent daytime feedings creates optimal conditions for night sleep. At this age, we target approximately two and a half to three and a half hours of total daytime sleep complemented by 10-12 hours of night sleep.

Some babies function best at the higher end of this range (3-3.5 hours), while others require the lower end (closer to 2.5-3 hours) to maintain adequate night sleep. You'll discover what works best for your baby through observation and experience. Whatever pattern emerges, maintain the three-and-a-half-hour daily maximum. If your baby currently achieves nowhere near two and a half to three and a half hours of total daytime sleep, don't worry—that's precisely why you're implementing this program. After consistent application, we expect to achieve approximately two and a half to three and a half hours of total daytime sleep, while respecting the three-and-a-half-hour daily maximum.

Our fourth and final goal prioritizes protecting night sleep. Research indicates that babies generally thrive with bedtimes between 6:30 and 8:00 PM. I personally found 7:00-7:30 PM ideal for my children. To support this optimal bedtime range while ensuring a full wake window before sleep, we must be mindful of when the day's final nap ends. Remember that bedtime typically varies within a range depending on how naps unfolded that particular day. Here's a simple guideline: to maintain a full wake window and target a 7:00-8:00 PM bedtime, your baby should wake from their final nap between 4:00 and 5:00 PM each evening.

Let's summarize our four routine goals: Wake windows range from two and a half to three and a half hours. No single nap exceeds two hours. Total napping hours are capped at three and a half hours maximum. The final nap of the day ends between 4:00 and 5:00 PM. Each morning, you'll begin your day and follow this general framework. While specific timing will vary slightly depending on nap lengths, these goals balance the structure and predictability your baby needs while giving you flexibility to manage real-life circumstances.

Review the sample schedules in the downloadable resources to see different ways this flexible routine might unfold throughout your day. Remember, these are examples of possibilities on any given day, not rigid schedules to follow precisely.

Making Decisions for Your Family

Let me begin with an important truth: there's no better parent for your baby than you. Nobody knows your little one like you do, and nobody could provide better care. In this section, I'll present some decisions for your consideration. Don't worry—I'll equip you with the tools needed to make the best choices for your baby and your family.

Formal nap training using the CALM Method involves establishing consistency, ensuring awake placement, providing loving support, and implementing measured timing. Be sure to review those videos for complete understanding. But perhaps you're wondering, "Is formal nap training really necessary right now?" That's entirely your decision. If your current approach is working well, there's no obligation to change it.

If you can quickly help your baby settle to sleep, place them in the crib, and they consistently nap longer than an hour, you might choose to continue your present method. If your baby naps while being held and you enjoy this arrangement, and it's providing at least two and a half hours of daytime sleep plus good night sleep, there's no reason to change. If you hold your baby for one nap and the other nap occurs while you're running errands due to your lifestyle, and this system works effectively, continue with it. If you're satisfied with your current situation and it's safe, maintain your approach.

You can still use this program to understand nap science, establish flexible daily routines, navigate transitions, and reference specific guidance if challenges arise. But how might you know when to consider formal nap training? Simply put, if your current approach isn't working optimally, it might be time for change. Here are some indicators that could suggest formal nap training would be beneficial:

You have established solid nighttime sleep and want to improve naps.

You previously had consistent night sleep but now experience night wakings or early morning wakings.

Putting your baby down for naps or achieving consolidated nap periods is becoming increasingly challenging.

Your baby only naps while being held, interfering with your family's overall well-being.

You intuitively feel ready to establish a solid nap foundation.

You're simultaneously addressing nighttime sleep and want to implement a comprehensive approach.

If any of these scenarios resonate with your situation, now might be the perfect time to begin formal nap training. To achieve optimal results, plan to be home for most naps during the initial 15 days—approximately 70% of naps should occur at home during this period. Ask yourself: Do I recognize signs that formal nap training would be beneficial? Can I commit to having 70% or more of naps at home for the next 15 days? If you answer yes to both questions, it's time to begin nap training. Don't approach this with apprehension—approach it with excitement. Your baby is capable of developing these skills, and life beyond inconsistent naps will be transformative for your entire family.

Parents of seven- to eight-month-olds, I want to address something specific to your situation. Research indicates that nap length and timing remain somewhat variable until approximately eight months of age. You're right at the developmental threshold when naps begin to show more consistency and regularity, but you may still experience occasional unpredictable days as your baby reaches this milestone. This presents you with a choice: will you meticulously track and analyze every detail of the schedule, or will you trust the natural progression of infant development?

Perfectionistic parents (myself included) tend to fixate on exact scheduling. I understand this tendency well—I've always strived to be the most effective parent possible. Detailed analysis is my natural inclination. However, research clearly demonstrates that nap patterns remain variable until around eight months. This doesn't mean your baby can't establish good naps earlier. It simply means you might experience significant day-to-day differences—perhaps a two-hour first nap on Monday becomes a 50-minute nap on Tuesday. The timing of the second nap might begin at 1:00 PM one day and 2:15 PM the next, depending on how the first nap unfolded.

These natural variations can prompt detail-oriented parents to analyze every aspect of the day, trying to identify exactly what created that "perfect" two-hour nap. While wake windows, activities, and our four goals certainly matter, sometimes the explanation is simply normal developmental variability. I encourage you to choose not to let these typical fluctuations diminish your joy or cause unnecessary stress. Predictable nap patterns are developing, and your baby will become a wonderful napper. We just need your patience and flexibility as your baby progresses through these important developmental stages.

Let's summarize our key points: If your current approach works well for your family, there's no need to change. But if you're ready for formal nap training, embrace the process with optimism—it truly will transform your daily life. Finally, I encourage you to trust the natural progression of infant development rather than obsessing over perfect scheduling.

Nap Training Specifics with the CALM Method

Now let's discuss the specific nap training elements for your baby at this seven- to ten-month stage. If you've already completed formal nap training when your baby was younger, you may not need this guidance currently—but keep it for reference if nap challenges arise in the future. Whether you encounter nap refusals, persistent short naps, or need to readjust your approach after travel or illness, these recommendations will help guide your decisions. For those beginning nap training for the first time at this age, let's explore the details.

First, ensure you have your Nap Training Specifics Guide from the resource materials. You'll need to customize several elements specifically for your seven- to ten-month-old. Please locate this guide now.

When your baby takes a short nap (45 minutes or less), we want to provide an opportunity for them to return to sleep independently. Babies transition through sleep cycles and may briefly awaken between cycles. By allowing them time to resettle without intervention, you help them develop the valuable skill of sleep cycle connection, leading to longer, more restorative naps.

In the Measured Timing section of the CALM Method, I recommend allowing 15-25 minutes for babies to return to sleep after a short nap. For seven- to ten-month-olds, I suggest using the full recommended window—aim for 15-20 minutes if your baby takes a nap lasting 45 minutes or less. This timeframe provides sufficient opportunity for your baby to practice connecting sleep cycles. If your baby successfully returns to sleep, that's excellent—this skill demonstrates significant sleep maturity.

Always maintain our maximum nap duration guideline: no single nap should exceed two hours. Calculate this two-hour period from the moment you initially place your baby in the crib. For example, if your baby enters the crib at 9:30 a.m., takes 15 minutes to fall asleep initially, wakes after 35 minutes, and requires another 15 minutes to return to sleep—you would still wake them at 11:30 a.m. if they're still sleeping, because that marks two hours from when they first entered the crib.

If your baby doesn't return to sleep within the allotted time, enter the room calmly, turn on the light, switch off the sound machine, and announce in a pleasant voice, "Nap time is over." Offer positive reinforcement—express how proud you are of their effort, give them a hug and kiss, then bring them into a bright, well-lit living area. This transition marks the beginning of the next wake window.

I must emphasize an important principle: Even following short naps, maintain appropriate wake window lengths. Allowing abbreviated wake periods after short naps creates an unproductive cycle that reinforces both brief naps and insufficient wake times. While your baby may appear sleepier than usual after a short nap, resist shortening the subsequent wake window significantly. Instead, ensure engaging, stimulating awake time by incorporating nutritious feeding, fresh air exposure, quality interaction, physical movement opportunities, and independent exploration. Observe your baby carefully and make minor adjustments within the recommended wake window range—you might schedule the next nap at three hours and 15 minutes rather than the full three and a half hours, for example, based on your observations.

I recognize that persistent short naps can feel discouraging, but view these as a normal part of the developmental process. Maintain consistency, verify that environmental conditions support sleep (ensuring room darkness, appropriate sound machine settings, and placing your baby in the crib fully awake), and eliminate factors that might prematurely reduce sleep pressure. With patience and persistence, longer, consolidated naps will develop.

You might wonder, "What if my baby refuses to sleep entirely?" This concern is natural, though complete nap refusal rarely persists beyond a brief period—the situation is seldom as challenging as we imagine it might be. If your seven- to ten-month-old does refuse a nap, allow up to 70 minutes for the attempt. This extended window provides ample opportunity to practice independent sleep skills. If sleep doesn't occur within this timeframe, enter the room, calmly turn on the lights, switch off the sound machine, and announce in a matter-of-fact tone that nap time has concluded. Your communication should clearly convey that crying doesn't trigger removal from the crib—it's simply the scheduled end of the nap period. Transition to a brightly lit area, acknowledge their effort positively, and shift focus to engaging activities.

Following a refused nap, provide 45-60 minutes of stimulating awake time. Use this period to connect with your baby, engage in playful interaction, seek fresh air if possible, and reset for another sleep attempt. If your baby needs nourishment during this time, offer it while ensuring they remain fully alert throughout the feeding to preserve sleep pressure. After this active period, implement the CALM Method again: conduct a brief 3-5 minute nap routine and attempt another nap. For this second try, limit the window to 45-60 minutes based on your comfort level and observations. Most babies who refuse the first attempt will successfully fall asleep during this second opportunity.

If your baby still doesn't sleep during the second attempt, maintain your positive approach—enter the room, turn on the lights, and conclude the nap period with the same upbeat, encouraging demeanor. Never communicate disappointment or frustration; your baby is working hard to develop new skills. Your facial expression and tone should convey confidence in their abilities and pride in their efforts.

After this second unsuccessful attempt, provide another 15-30 minutes of quality awake time focused on resetting. Connect meaningfully, play together, seek fresh air if possible, and prepare for the next step. When appropriate, transition to an assisted nap—help your baby fall asleep through holding, using a baby carrier, gentle back rubbing, or rocking. The goal is facilitating sleep in a safe environment outside the nursery. At this point, your baby may be experiencing significant fatigue, and preventing further overtiredness becomes the priority. Your baby has already practiced independent sleep skills extensively; now they simply need rest. For the remainder of that day, follow your routine framework and offer assisted naps as needed. Tomorrow brings another opportunity—your baby will gradually develop these skills with consistent practice.

Remember that extended refusal of multiple nap attempts is uncommon. Maintain consistency, follow the recommended approach, and trust the process. Nap refusals typically resolve relatively quickly with persistent, gentle guidance.

Visualizing Success

Let me help you envision our ultimate destination with this process. Here's what we're working toward during the seven- to ten-month

Visualizing Success

Let me help you envision our ultimate destination with this process. Here's what we're working toward during the seven- to ten-month stage:

Your baby falls asleep independently within five to 20 minutes at both nap time and bedtime.

Both naps consistently last at least 50 to 60 minutes each.

Total daytime sleep amounts to two and a half to three and a half hours.

Wake windows of approximately three to three and a half hours are comfortably tolerated.

Bedtime consistently falls between 6:30 and 8:00 p.m.

Your baby sleeps until 6:00 a.m. or later each morning.

These represent our aspirational targets. I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining realistic expectations. Even with consistent implementation, achieving these goals typically requires two to four weeks of consistent, active nap training. Will we accomplish every goal perfectly each day? Realistically, no. Your baby is a unique individual with natural variability, not a programmable device. These objectives represent what we aim for most days, not every single day without exception.

Keep our guiding principle in mind: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Life inevitably presents situations that require adaptation—perhaps special activities like a music class or swimming lesson take you away from home, or perhaps you choose to meet a friend for lunch and your baby naps in the stroller at the restaurant. Maybe your baby's second nap routinely occurs in the car during school pickup for an older sibling. These adaptations are perfectly acceptable—they reflect what works for your family's specific circumstances.

I want to clearly articulate what success means in this context. Success isn't defined by adhering to a perfect schedule or achieving two long, consolidated crib naps every single day. Rather, success means your baby develops healthy sleep skills, enjoys restful sleep, maintains a happy disposition, and you possess effective strategies to implement when needed. The goal isn't creating a good sleeper merely for the sake of having a good sleeper—it's enabling your entire family to thrive through better rest. You absolutely have the capability to achieve this.

Before concluding, a brief note about future development: Once your baby reaches 11 months of age, I recommend returning to review the next section. I'll provide guidance on the subtle adjustments needed during that stage. Finally, if additional questions arise, please first consult the FAQ section. Should you need personalized guidance, remember you're not alone in this journey. Consider adding a consultation with one of our certified sleep specialists who can work with you individually to address specific challenges. Their expertise is available whenever you need additional support. You have everything necessary to succeed.

11-14 Months (2 Naps)

Goals and Typical Routines for 11-14 Month Olds

Hello there, amazing parents of 11- to 14-month-olds! I'm so happy you're here. This is truly an exciting stage in your baby's development - a time when sleep patterns can really start to come together with your loving guidance. I know the journey to better sleep can feel overwhelming at times, but I want you to know that you're not alone, and you're doing an incredible job already by seeking support.

I want you to know that whether this is your first time exploring our age-specific content or you're continuing from earlier modules, you're in exactly the right place at the right time. Many parents find that babies at this age respond beautifully to consistent sleep guidance. If you're feeling exhausted right now, I see you, I understand those feelings of frustration and fatigue, and I want you to know that better sleep is absolutely possible for your family. The fact that you're here, taking this step, shows what a dedicated parent you are. Your efforts matter, and they will pay off.

Let's start with our core philosophy that will guide everything we do: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Say that with me - "flexible routine, not rigid schedule." I know many of us crave structure and predictability (I certainly do!), but remember we're working with wonderful little humans, not robots. Your ability to find that sweet spot between structure and flexibility is such a gift to your child. When you feel overwhelmed by schedule details or worried about getting everything "just right," take a deep breath and remember this mantra. Give yourself permission to adapt and adjust as needed. This approach not only helps your baby thrive but also relieves you of the pressure to be perfect. And that's something we all need as parents.

I'm going to help you establish a rhythm that works, but our real goal is creating a framework that sets your days up for success while making room for real life to happen. Because life with a toddler is wonderfully unpredictable, isn't it?

Four Key Elements for Better Sleep

When we're creating your baby's daily rhythm, I recommend focusing on four key elements that will help promote truly restorative sleep:

First, let's talk about wake windows between three and four hours. Think of these wake periods as time when your little one is "charging their sleep battery." They need enough awake time to build sufficient sleep pressure for those quality naps we're all hoping for.

Let me walk you through what this typically looks like: Your baby wakes up bright-eyed in the morning, and about three hours later takes their first nap. Then approximately three to three and a half hours after that first nap ends comes nap number two. Finally, three and a half to four hours after the second nap wraps up, it's bedtime.

You might notice some patterns here - the wake windows generally range from three to four hours, and they tend to start shorter in the morning and gradually lengthen as the day progresses. Your 11-month-old might do beautifully with a three-hour window before that first nap, while your 14-month-old might need closer to three and a half or even four hours to be truly ready for sleep.

These are ranges, not rigid rules - I want you to watch your baby and trust what you see. You're becoming more expert in reading your child's cues every single day, and that insight is invaluable. You'll likely find that as your baby grows, they'll gradually need those longer wake windows to build enough sleep pressure.

I want to pause here and acknowledge that some of you might already have wake windows that match these targets - if that's you, that's wonderful! Your consistency is really paying off. Others of you might be thinking, "My baby can barely stay awake for two and a half hours without melting down!" I completely understand that concern, and I want to reassure you that we'll work on gradually extending your baby's awake time - just aim for 10-15 additional minutes per wake window to start.

When you see those sleepy cues starting to appear, try changing the environment or introducing an activity your baby loves. Maybe they enjoy stacking blocks, exploring kitchen cabinets, splashing in a water table, or taking a walk around the neighborhood. The goal is to gently extend their wakefulness without pushing them into overtired territory.

Remember that wake windows start the moment you lift your baby from the crib and end when you place them back in. If you've been following our program since your baby was younger, you'll notice these goals are similar in concept but adjusted for your growing toddler's developmental needs.

Keeping Naps the Right Length

Our second focus is on nap duration. At this age, no single nap should exceed two hours. I know what you might be thinking - "Wait, you want me to wake my sleeping baby?" If their nap reaches the two-hour mark, then yes - and I promise there's good reason for this! I completely understand how counterintuitive this feels. That moment when you have to wake a peacefully sleeping baby can be so hard, especially when you've worked so diligently for that sleep. But trust me on this one - this small action now leads to better overall sleep patterns that will benefit your whole family.

When naps go too long, they can interfere with your baby's feeding schedule, reduce the active awake time they need for development, and push bedtime later than ideal - all of which can lead to night wakings. When your baby hits that two-hour mark during a nap, gently ease them awake by opening the door, turning off the sound machine, drawing back the curtains, and speaking in a soft, soothing voice. As their eyes flutter open, bring them into a well-lit space to start the next wake window.

If your baby rarely naps close to two hours anyway, please don't worry! Short naps don't mean you're doing anything wrong - many babies take time to consolidate their sleep cycles. Every baby is unique in how they nap, and this program will help establish better sleep patterns over time. Just keep in mind that two-hour cap on individual naps.

Balancing Daily Sleep Totals

Our third element focuses on total daily nap duration: we recommend keeping total daytime sleep to no more than three hours. This means distributing those hours across two naps, which means both naps can't hit the two-hour maximum on the same day. I've included sample schedules in your downloadable resources that show different ways to organize these sleep periods. Sometimes you might need to gently wake your baby to keep within this three-hour total.

Why does this matter so much? Your growing toddler needs plenty of active, engaged awake time for their development. Finding this balance between sleep and active time isn't always easy, but you're doing such important work in supporting both your baby's sleep needs and their developmental journey.

Too much daytime sleep can actually reduce nighttime sleep, which ideally should be 10-12 hours of deep, restorative sleep. The sweet spot is balancing active awake time, quality naps, and consistent daytime feedings to create the best conditions for night sleep.

At this age, we're aiming for about two and a half to three hours of total daytime sleep paired with 10-12 hours at night. Some babies do best with closer to 3 hours during the day, while others need closer to 2.5 hours to maintain good night sleep. You'll discover your baby's unique sleep needs through your observations - trust your growing expertise as their parent. Whatever pattern emerges, try to maintain that three-hour daily maximum.

If your baby currently gets nowhere near two and a half to three hours of total daytime sleep, please don't worry - that's exactly why you're implementing this program! With your loving consistency, you'll see positive changes. There may be challenging days that make you question whether it's working, and that's completely normal. Remember that progress isn't always linear - sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. What matters is your overall direction. After following this approach consistently, most families find their baby's daytime sleep naturally increases to that two and a half to three hour range while staying within the three-hour maximum. Your persistence will be rewarded, I promise.

Protecting Night Sleep

Our fourth and final element is all about protecting night sleep. Research shows that babies generally thrive with bedtimes between 6:30 and 8:00 PM. In my own family, I found 7:00-7:30 PM worked beautifully for my children. To support this bedtime range while ensuring your baby has a full wake window before bed, we need to be thoughtful about when the final nap of the day ends.

Bedtime will naturally vary a bit depending on how naps went that day. Here's a simple guideline: to maintain a full wake window and target a 7:00-8:00 PM bedtime, your baby should wake from their final nap between 3:30 and 4:30 PM each evening.

So let's recap our four key elements:

Wake windows range from three to four hours

No single nap exceeds two hours

Total napping hours are capped at three hours maximum

The final nap of the day ends between 3:30 and 4:30 PM

Each morning, you'll begin your day with this framework in mind. The specific timing will vary a bit depending on nap lengths, but these guidelines provide the structure your baby needs while giving you the flexibility to adapt to real life.

Remember that some days will go exactly as planned, and others absolutely won't - and both are completely normal! I've included sample schedules in your resources that show different ways this flexible routine might unfold throughout your day. These are examples of possibilities, not rigid schedules you need to follow precisely.

Making Choices That Work for YOUR Family

I want to start this section by acknowledging an important truth: there is no better parent for your baby than you. Nobody knows your child like you do, and nobody could provide better care. Your intuition is one of your greatest parenting tools - trust it.

In this section, I'll present some choices for you to consider, and I'll equip you with everything you need to make the best decisions for your unique baby and family situation.

Formal nap training using our CALM Method (which stands for Consistency, Awake placement, Loving support, and Measured timing) is one approach. If you haven't watched those videos yet, please be sure to review them for a complete understanding of the method.

But perhaps you're wondering, "Do I really need to do formal nap training right now?" That's entirely your decision. If your current approach is working well for your family, there's absolutely no obligation to change it.

That said, many parents notice that around this age, the way naps are managed starts to directly impact nighttime sleep. Earlier in development, naps and night sleep developed somewhat separately, but now they begin to converge. If you're noticing that nights and naps are becoming increasingly challenging because your baby isn't napping independently, it might be time to consider a new approach.

If you decide that formal nap training isn't right for your family right now, you can absolutely still use this program to understand the science of naps, establish your flexible routine, and navigate nap transitions. Every family is different, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to baby sleep.

But here are some signs that might suggest nap training would be beneficial:

You have solid nights but want to improve your naps

You previously had good nights, but now you're experiencing night wakings or early morning wakings

It's becoming increasingly difficult to get your baby down for naps or to achieve consolidated nap periods

Your baby only naps when held, and this is affecting your whole family's wellbeing

You feel in your heart that you're ready to establish a solid nap foundation

You're working on nighttime sleep improvements and want to align nights and naps

If any of these reasons resonate with you, it might be the perfect time to begin. Taking this step shows such dedication to your baby's development - be proud of yourself for making this choice! For best results, try to be home for most naps during the first 15 days - aim for about 70% of naps at home during this initial period.

Ask yourself: Am I seeing consistent signs that it's time for a change? And can I commit to having 70% or more of our naps at home for the next 15 days? If you answer yes to both questions, then get excited - your baby can absolutely do this, and life beyond inconsistent naps will be truly wonderful for your entire family.

Nap Training with the CALM Method

Now let's talk specifically about nap training for your 11- to 14-month-old. If you've already done formal nap training when your baby was younger, you might not need this guidance right now - but keep it handy in case nap challenges arise later on. Whether you encounter nap refusals, persistent short naps, or need to reset after travel or illness, these recommendations will help guide your decisions.

First, make sure you have your Nap Training Specifics Guide from the resource materials. You'll need to customize several elements specifically for your 11- to 14-month-old. Please take a moment to locate this guide now.

When your baby takes a short nap (45 minutes or less), we want to give them a chance to return to sleep independently. Babies cycle through different sleep stages and sometimes briefly wake between cycles. By allowing them time to resettle without your help, you're supporting them in developing the valuable skill of connecting sleep cycles, which leads to longer, more restorative naps.

In the Measured Timing part of our CALM Method, I generally recommend allowing 15-25 minutes for babies to return to sleep after a short nap. For 11- to 14-month-olds specifically, I suggest using the full recommended window - aim for 20-25 minutes if your baby takes a nap lasting 45 minutes or less. This timeframe honors your baby's developmental stage while encouraging important sleep skill-building. If your baby successfully returns to sleep, that's wonderful! This skill shows significant sleep maturity.

Always maintain our two-hour maximum guideline for any single nap. Calculate this two-hour period from the moment you initially place your baby in the crib. For example, if you put your baby in the crib at 9:30 a.m., they take 15 minutes to fall asleep, wake after 35 minutes, and then take another 20 minutes to return to sleep - you would still wake them at 11:30 a.m. if they're still sleeping, because that marks two hours from the start of nap time.

If your baby doesn't return to sleep within the allotted time, enter the room calmly, turn on the light, switch off the sound machine, and say in a warm, pleasant voice, "Nap time is over, sweetie." Offer positive reinforcement - give them a hug and kiss, tell them how proud you are of their efforts, then bring them into a bright, well-lit living area to begin the next wake window.

When Naps Are Short

I want to emphasize something important: Even after short naps, try to maintain appropriate wake window lengths. Consistency is so key to helping your baby develop predictable sleep patterns. When we allow shortened wake periods after short naps, we unintentionally create a cycle that reinforces both brief naps and insufficient wake times.

I know your baby might seem extra sleepy after a short nap, but resist the urge to shorten the next wake window significantly. Instead, focus on making that awake time engaging and stimulating - offer a nutritious snack, get some fresh air if possible, have some quality playtime together, encourage physical movement, and provide opportunities for independent exploration. Watch your baby carefully and make small adjustments within the recommended wake window range - maybe schedule the next nap at three hours and fifteen minutes instead of the full three and a half hours, based on what you're observing.

I understand that persistent short naps can feel really discouraging, but please view them as a normal part of your baby's development. Every child develops at their own pace, and your consistent, loving guidance is exactly what they need right now. On those days when you feel defeated after yet another 30-minute nap, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're doing everything right. These challenges don't reflect on your parenting - they're just part of the process. Stay consistent, make sure the sleep environment supports good rest (dark room, appropriate sound machine, placing baby in crib fully awake), and eliminate anything that might prematurely reduce sleep pressure. With your patience and persistence, those longer, consolidated naps will develop. I've seen thousands of families move through this exact struggle to find success, and I believe in you completely.

When Your Baby Refuses to Nap

You might be wondering, "What if my baby refuses to nap entirely?" This concern is completely natural, though complete nap refusal rarely lasts long - the situation is usually not as challenging as we fear it might be.

If your 11- to 14-month-old does refuse a nap, allow up to 70 minutes for the attempt. This extended window gives plenty of opportunity to practice independent sleep skills. If sleep doesn't happen within this timeframe, enter the room calmly, turn on the lights, switch off the sound machine, and say in a matter-of-fact, warm tone that nap time has concluded. Your approach should clearly show that crying doesn't trigger immediate removal from the crib - it's simply the scheduled end of the nap period. Transition to a bright area, acknowledge their effort positively, and shift to engaging activities.

After a refused nap, provide 45-60 minutes of stimulating awake time. Use this period to connect with your baby, play together, get some fresh air if possible, and reset for another sleep attempt. This quality time together helps both of you regroup - your positive attitude makes such a difference here! If your baby needs a snack during this time, that's fine, just make sure they stay fully alert during feeding to preserve sleep pressure.

After this active period, try the CALM Method again: do a brief 3-5 minute nap routine and attempt another nap. For this second try, limit the window to 45-60 minutes based on your comfort level and observations. Most babies who refuse the first attempt will successfully fall asleep during this second opportunity.

If your baby still doesn't sleep during the second attempt, maintain your positive approach - go in, turn on the lights, and end nap time with the same warm, encouraging demeanor. Never show disappointment or frustration; your baby is working so hard to develop these new skills. Your facial expression and tone should show confidence in their abilities and pride in their efforts. I know this moment can be particularly challenging - when you've invested time and emotional energy into two nap attempts with no success, it's natural to feel frustrated or even defeated. But I want you to know that how you handle these difficult moments matters tremendously, both for your baby and for yourself. By remaining calm and positive, you're teaching resilience and emotional regulation that will benefit your child well beyond these nap challenges.

After this second unsuccessful attempt, provide another 30-60 minutes of quality awake time focused on resetting. Connect meaningfully, play together, get some fresh air if possible, and prepare for the next step. Then, transition to an assisted nap - help your baby fall asleep through holding, using a baby carrier, gentle back rubbing, or rocking. The goal now is helping them sleep in a safe environment outside the nursery.

At this point, your baby is likely experiencing significant tiredness, and preventing further overtiredness becomes the priority. Remember that being flexible shows strength, not weakness - meeting your baby's needs in this moment is exactly what they need from you. They've already practiced independent sleep skills extensively today; now they simply need rest. For the rest of that day, follow your routine framework and offer assisted naps as needed. Tomorrow brings a fresh opportunity - your baby will gradually develop these skills with your consistent, loving guidance.

I want to reassure you that extended refusal of multiple nap attempts is uncommon. Stay consistent, follow the approach we've discussed, and trust the process. Your patience is creating a foundation for healthy sleep habits that will benefit your child long into the future. Nap refusals typically resolve relatively quickly with gentle, persistent guidance.

What Success Looks Like

Let me help you envision our destination with this process. Here's what we're working toward during the 11- to 14-month stage:

Your baby falls asleep independently within 5-20 minutes at both nap time and bedtime

Both naps consistently last at least 50-60 minutes each

Total daytime sleep amounts to two and a half to three hours

Wake windows of approximately three to three and a half hours are comfortably tolerated

Bedtime consistently falls between 6:30-8:00 p.m.

Your baby sleeps until 6:00 a.m. or later each morning

These represent our targets, but I want to emphasize the importance of realistic expectations. Real progress happens in small steps, not perfect days - celebrate each little improvement along the way! Even with consistent implementation, achieving these goals typically requires two to four weeks of active nap training.

Will we accomplish every goal perfectly each day? Realistically, no. Your baby is a unique individual with natural variability - not a programmable device. These objectives represent what we aim for most days, not every single day without exception. The journey to better sleep isn't about perfection - it's about progress. On difficult days, remind yourself of how far you've come rather than focusing on today's challenges. Every parent experiences setbacks during sleep training, and these moments don't erase the progress you've made. Be gentle with yourself when things don't go as planned.

Keep our guiding principle in mind: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Life will present situations that require adaptation - maybe you have a music class or swimming lesson, or perhaps you're meeting a friend for lunch and your baby naps in the stroller at the restaurant. These adaptations are perfectly acceptable - they reflect what works for your family's specific circumstances.

I want to be clear about what success really means in this context. Success isn't defined by sticking to a perfect schedule or achieving two long, consolidated crib naps every single day. Rather, success means your baby develops healthy sleep skills, enjoys restful sleep, maintains a happy disposition, and you have effective strategies to implement when needed. Your goal isn't creating a good sleeper just for the sake of having a good sleeper - it's enabling your entire family to thrive through better rest. You absolutely have the capability to achieve this.

Before we wrap up, a quick note about future development: Most babies will transition from two naps to one around 14-18 months. Don't rush this process - if your current routine is working well, there's no need to force a change.

I want you to trust your parenting instincts, celebrate every small victory along the way, and know that you're doing an incredible job. Even on the hardest days - especially on the hardest days - remind yourself that this challenging period is temporary, but the healthy sleep habits you're building will benefit your child for years to come. Your dedication, your consistency, and your love are making a profound difference. You have everything you need to succeed, and I'm so proud of you for investing in your family's sleep health. When you feel overwhelmed, come back to this moment and remember why you started. Remember that countless parents have walked this path before you and found success, even when it seemed impossible. You are stronger and more capable than you realize. You've got this, and I'm here with you every step of the way!

14-24 Months (1 Nap)

Goals and Typical Routines

Hello wonderful parents of little ones who have transitioned to one nap! I'm so excited you're here. This guidance is specifically crafted just for you and your toddler at this special stage. You've reached a significant milestone in your child's development - the one-nap schedule is a big transition that signals your baby is growing into a toddler. I know this journey hasn't always been easy, but your dedication to supporting your little one's sleep needs is truly admirable.

Typically, babies transitioning to a single nap are around 14-17 months and older, though some may make this shift as early as 12-13 months while others might maintain two solid naps until 17-18 months. My goal is always to meet your child exactly where they are developmentally, recognizing that every baby follows their unique timeline. There's no "right" age for this transition - your child's individual needs are what matter most.

If you're uncertain whether your baby is ready or if you're navigating an in-between stage, I recommend starting with the Two-to-One Nap Transition section first. However, if your little one is comfortably taking one midday nap, this section is precisely what you need. Trust your instincts about where your child falls in this range - you know them better than anyone.

Whether this is your first encounter with the age-specific content or you've been following along since your baby was younger, you'll find valuable information here. While some concepts will feel familiar to those who've worked through earlier sections, we'll focus on adjusting specific elements to align with your child's current developmental stage.

Creating a Flexible Routine

Let's begin with your baby's daily schedule. Remember our foundational principle: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Say it with me—flexible routine, not rigid schedule. This distinction matters because many parents naturally desire predictable structure for their baby. While your little one certainly benefits from consistency and pattern, this mantra reminds us that we're working with a developing human being, not a programmable device.

When you feel overwhelmed by schedule details or worried about getting everything "just right," take a deep breath and remember this mantra. Give yourself permission to adapt and adjust as needed. This approach not only helps your toddler thrive but also relieves you of the pressure to be perfect. And that's something we all need as parents.

I'll help you establish an effective framework, but the ultimate goal is creating a structure that sets your days up for success while allowing space for real life to unfold. Remember that some days will go exactly as planned, and others absolutely won't - and both are completely normal!

Three Key Objectives for Optimal Sleep

When developing your toddler's daily routine, I recommend three key objectives that will promote optimal sleep. First, aim for wake windows between four and six hours. I know this might sound long if you're just transitioning from two naps, but your growing toddler is developing the ability to stay awake for longer stretches while remaining happy and engaged. We'll work up to these windows gradually.

Let me illustrate how these intervals typically unfold throughout the day. Your child wakes in the morning, and approximately five to six hours later takes their midday nap. Then, approximately four to five hours after the nap concludes, bedtime arrives.

Notice several important patterns in this framework: The morning wake window tends to be longer than the afternoon wake window—this represents a significant shift from previous schedules. During all earlier developmental stages, the shortest wake window of the day has been the morning one, with wake windows gradually lengthening throughout the day.

With the transition to one nap, this pattern flips—we now need a longer morning window to build adequate sleep pressure for a substantial midday nap, typically beginning around noon or later. This consolidated nap then requires a slightly shorter afternoon window before bedtime. This flip can feel counterintuitive at first, but I promise your child will adjust beautifully with your consistent support.

It's important to note that I'm addressing parents of children ranging from 14-month-olds who have just transitioned to one nap, all the way to 24-month-olds who have been on this schedule for some time. As children grow, they typically require longer wake windows overall. For instance, a 13- to 14-month-old might only manage four to four and a half hours for that afternoon wake window, while a 22- to 24-month-old may need closer to five hours.

These are ranges—observe your child's responses and adjust accordingly. Your observations are invaluable - you're becoming more expert in reading your toddler's sleep cues with each passing day. As your little one continues developing, you'll generally need to extend toward the longer end of these ranges.

If your toddler isn't quite reaching these windows yet, don't worry! Progress comes in small steps. We'll work on gradually extending their awake time—aim for just 15-20 additional minutes per wake window to start. When sleepy cues emerge, change the environment or introduce engaging activities your little one enjoys. The objective is gently extending wakefulness without pushing into overtired territory.

Remember that wake windows start when you remove your baby from the crib and end when you place them back in the crib. For parents who previously implemented guidance for younger babies, you'll notice the following goals have shifted substantially to accommodate this major developmental transition.

Nap Duration and Quality

Our second goal addresses nap duration. With the transition to a single daily nap, we want to ensure this sleep period provides adequate restoration. At this developmental stage, we don't want the midday nap to exceed three hours total. I understand how counterintuitive it feels to wake a peacefully sleeping toddler, especially when that precious naptime might be your only break in the day. But trust me on this one - this small action now leads to better overall sleep patterns that will benefit your whole family.

Extended naps can interfere with daytime activities, reduce total awake time needed for development, and potentially delay bedtime—all factors that can increase night wakings. When your toddler's nap reaches the three-hour mark, gently wake them using the same approach we've discussed for younger ages.

If your little one rarely naps close to this three-hour limit, please don't worry! Nap duration varies between children, and this program will help establish better consolidated sleep. The quality of the nap matters more than hitting a specific duration target. Some toddlers thrive with a solid two-hour nap, while others need closer to three hours. You'll discover your child's unique sleep needs through observation - trust your growing expertise as a parent.

If your toddler currently gets nowhere near two to three hours of total daytime sleep, don't worry—that's exactly why you're implementing this program! With your loving consistency, you'll see positive changes. There may be challenging days that make you question whether it's working, and that's completely normal. Remember that progress isn't always linear - sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. What matters is your overall direction.

Protecting Night Sleep

Our third goal prioritizes protecting night sleep. Research indicates that toddlers generally thrive with bedtimes between 6:30 and 8:00 PM. I personally found 7:00-7:30 PM ideal for my children. To support this optimal bedtime range while ensuring a full wake window before sleep, we must be mindful of when the midday nap ends.

Here's a simple guideline: to maintain a full wake window and target a 7:00-8:00 PM bedtime, your toddler should wake from their nap between 3:00 and 4:00 PM each afternoon. This timing ensures they have enough wake time before bed without becoming overtired.

Let's summarize our three routine goals:

Wake windows range from four to six hours, with the nap typically occurring around noon or later

Limit the midday nap to a maximum of three hours

Ensure the nap ends by 3:00-4:00 PM

Each morning, you'll begin your day and follow this general framework. While specific timing will vary slightly depending on nap length, these goals balance the structure and predictability your child needs while giving you flexibility to manage real-life circumstances. Remember that flexibility is key—some days will follow this pattern beautifully, and others might be completely different. Both are perfectly normal and part of parenting a toddler!

Review the sample schedules in the downloadable resources to see different ways this flexible routine might unfold throughout your day. Remember, these are examples of possibilities on any given day, not rigid schedules to follow precisely.

Making Decisions for Your Family

Let me begin with an important truth: there's no better parent for your child than you. Nobody knows your little one like you do, and nobody could provide better care. Trust your intuition—it's one of your greatest parenting tools. In this section, I'll present some decisions for your consideration. Don't worry—I'll equip you with the tools needed to make the best choices for your child and your family.

Formal nap training using the CALM Method involves establishing consistency, ensuring awake placement, providing loving support, and implementing measured timing. Be sure to review those videos for complete understanding. But perhaps you're wondering, "Is formal nap training really necessary right now?" That's entirely your decision. If your current approach is working well, there's no obligation to change it.

If you can quickly help your child settle to sleep, place them in the crib, and they consistently nap longer than two hours, you might choose to continue your present method. If your child naps while being held and you enjoy this arrangement, and it's providing at least two hours of daytime sleep plus good night sleep, there's no reason to change. Honor what works for your family—there's no one-size-fits-all approach to toddler sleep. If you're satisfied with your current situation and it's safe, maintain your approach.

However, I do need to emphasize something important that happens for many children at this developmental stage: there comes a time—often about now or even a bit earlier—when the way naps are handled begins to significantly impact nighttime sleep. Before now, naps have been developing somewhat independently from night sleep, but at this stage, these sleep periods begin to influence each other more substantially. This might be the perfect time to consider formal nap training so you can establish healthy sleep patterns across all sleep periods. For some children, both nights and naps may become increasingly challenging if they haven't developed independent sleep skills.

If you decide formal nap training isn't for you right now, you can still use this program to understand nap science, establish your flexible routine, and navigate transitions. But if you're noticing any of these indicators, nap training might be beneficial:

You have solid nights but want to solidify your child's nap

You previously had solid nights, but now experience night wakings or early morning wakings

It's becoming increasingly difficult to get your child down for a nap or to achieve a consolidated midday sleep period

Your child only naps when held, interfering with your family's overall well-being

You feel instinctively that it's time to establish a solid nap foundation

You're addressing nighttime sleep and want to create comprehensive sleep skills

If any of these scenarios resonate with your situation, now might be the perfect time to begin formal nap training. I know it can feel daunting to make this commitment, especially when you're already navigating the challenges of toddlerhood. Remember that the temporary challenge of sleep training is worth the long-term benefit of healthy sleep for your entire family. Many parents tell me it was one of the best parenting decisions they ever made, even though it wasn't always easy.

For optimal results, plan to be home for most naps during the initial 15 days—approximately 70% of naps should occur at home during this period. This consistency during the learning phase will set you up for more flexibility later.

Ask yourself: Do I recognize signs that formal nap training would be beneficial? Can I commit to having 70% or more of naps at home for the next 15 days? If you answer yes to both questions, it's time to begin. Taking this step shows incredible commitment to your child's development—be proud of yourself for making this choice. Approach this process with excitement rather than apprehension—your child is capable of developing these important skills, and improved naps will be transformative for your entire family.

Nap Training Specifics with the CALM Method

Now let's discuss the specific nap training elements for your child at this fourteen- to twenty-four-month stage. If you've already completed formal nap training when your little one was younger, you may not need this guidance currently—but keep it for reference if nap challenges arise. Whether you encounter nap refusals, persistent short naps, or need to readjust your approach after travel or illness, these recommendations will guide your decisions. For those beginning nap training for the first time at this age, let's explore the specifics.

First, ensure you have your Nap Training Specifics Guide from the resource materials. You'll need to customize several elements specifically for your fourteen- to twenty-four-month-old. Please locate this guide now.

In my earlier CALM Method videos, I explained that if your baby takes a short nap of 45 minutes or less, we need to provide an opportunity for them to return to sleep. Now that your little one is taking only one nap per day, we need that nap to be a substantial one—ideally at least two hours long.

Here's an adjustment for this age range: if your child naps for 90 minutes or less, give them an opportunity to fall back to sleep without entering the room. Remember, children transition through sleep cycles and may awaken slightly between cycles. By allowing 20-25 minutes of uninterrupted time (based on your comfort level), you provide an opportunity for them to achieve a longer, consolidated nap. This adjustment honors your child's developmental stage while still encouraging sleep skill building. If they successfully return to sleep, that's excellent—this demonstrates advanced sleep connection skills.

However, we never want the midday nap to exceed three hours total. Count three hours from the time your child first enters the crib—we won't subtract the extra time it took them to settle back to sleep. For example, if your child goes into the crib at 12:00 p.m., takes 30 minutes to fall asleep initially, then wakes after 60 minutes of sleep, and you give them time to resettle—you would still wake them at 3:00 p.m. if they're still sleeping, because that marks three hours from when they first entered the crib.

If your child doesn't return to sleep within the allotted time, enter the room calmly, turn on the light, switch off the sound machine, and announce pleasantly, "Nap time is over, sweetie." Offer positive reinforcement—express how proud you are of their effort, give them a hug and kiss, then bring them into a bright, well-lit living area. This transition marks the beginning of the afternoon wake window.

Maintaining Appropriate Wake Windows

I must emphasize an important principle: Even following a shorter-than-ideal nap, maintain appropriate wake window lengths. Consistency is key to helping your toddler develop predictable sleep patterns—you're doing important work here. Allowing abbreviated wake periods after short naps creates an unproductive cycle that reinforces both brief naps and insufficient wake times.

While your child may appear sleepier than usual after a short nap, resist shortening the subsequent wake window significantly. Instead, ensure engaging, stimulating awake time by incorporating nutritious feeding, fresh air exposure, quality interaction, physical movement opportunities, and independent exploration. Observe your child carefully and make minor adjustments within the recommended wake window range—you might adjust the afternoon wake window to three hours and 50 minutes instead of the full four hours, for example, based on your observations.

I recognize that persistent short naps can feel discouraging, but view these as a normal part of the developmental process. On those days when you feel defeated after yet another short nap, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're doing everything right. These challenges don't reflect on your parenting - they're just part of the process. Maintain consistency, verify that environmental conditions support sleep (ensuring room darkness, appropriate sound machine settings, and placing your child in the crib fully awake), and eliminate factors that might prematurely reduce sleep pressure.

With patience and persistence, longer, consolidated naps will develop. I've seen thousands of families move through this exact struggle to find success, and I believe in you completely.

Handling Nap Refusals

You might wonder, "What if my child refuses to sleep entirely?" This concern is natural, though complete nap refusal rarely persists beyond a brief period—the situation is seldom as challenging as we imagine it might be. If your fourteen- to twenty-four-month-old does refuse a nap, allow up to 70 minutes for the attempt. This extended window provides ample opportunity to practice independent sleep skills.

If sleep doesn't occur within this timeframe, enter the room, calmly turn on the lights, switch off the sound machine, and announce in a matter-of-fact tone that nap time has concluded. Your communication should clearly convey that crying doesn't trigger removal from the crib—it's simply the scheduled end of the nap period. Transition to a brightly lit area, acknowledge their effort positively, and shift focus to engaging activities.

Following a refused nap, provide 30-45 minutes of stimulating awake time. Use this period to connect with your child, engage in playful interaction, seek fresh air if possible, and reset for another sleep attempt. This quality time together helps both of you reset - your positive attitude makes all the difference here. If your child needs nourishment during this time, offer it while ensuring they remain fully alert throughout to preserve sleep pressure.

After this active period, implement the CALM Method again: conduct a brief 3-5 minute nap routine and attempt another nap. For this second try, limit the window to 35-45 minutes based on your comfort level and observations. Most children who refuse the first attempt will successfully fall asleep during this second opportunity.

If your child still doesn't sleep during the second attempt, maintain your positive approach—enter the room, turn on the lights, and conclude the nap period with the same upbeat, encouraging demeanor. I know this moment can be particularly challenging - when you've invested time and emotional energy into two nap attempts with no success, it's natural to feel frustrated or even defeated. But I want you to know that how you handle these difficult moments matters tremendously, both for your child and for yourself. By remaining calm and positive, you're teaching resilience and emotional regulation that will benefit your child well beyond these nap challenges.

Never communicate disappointment or frustration; your child is working hard to develop skills. Your facial expression and tone should convey confidence in their abilities and pride in their efforts.

After this second unsuccessful attempt, provide another 30 minutes of quality awake time focused on resetting. Connect meaningfully, play together, seek fresh air if possible, and prepare for the next step. When appropriate, transition to an assisted nap—help your child fall asleep through holding, using a carrier, gentle back rubbing, or rocking. The goal is facilitating sleep in a safe environment.

At this point, your child may be experiencing significant fatigue, and preventing further overtiredness becomes the priority. Remember that flexibility shows strength, not weakness - meeting your child's needs in this moment is exactly what they need from you. Your little one has already practiced independent sleep skills extensively; now they simply need rest. For the remainder of that day, follow your routine framework. Tomorrow brings another opportunity—your child will gradually develop these skills with consistent practice.

Remember that extended refusal of multiple nap attempts is uncommon. Maintain consistency, follow the recommended approach, and trust the process. Your consistency and patience are creating a foundation for healthy sleep habits that will benefit your child long-term. Nap refusals typically resolve relatively quickly with persistent, gentle guidance.

Visualizing Success

Let me help you envision our ultimate destination with this process. Here's what we're working toward during the fourteen- to twenty-four-month stage:

Your child falls asleep independently within 5 to 30 minutes at both nap time and bedtime

The midday nap consistently lasts 2 to 3 hours

Wake windows of approximately 5 to 6 hours in the morning and 4 to 5 hours in the afternoon are comfortably tolerated

Bedtime consistently falls between 6:30 and 8:00 p.m.

Your child sleeps until 6:00 a.m. or later each morning

These represent our aspirational targets. I want to emphasize the importance of maintaining realistic expectations. Real progress happens in small steps, not perfect days - celebrate each improvement along the way. Even with consistent implementation, achieving these goals typically requires three to four weeks of consistent, active nap training.

Will we accomplish every goal perfectly each day? Realistically, no. Your child is a unique individual with natural variability, not a programmable device. These objectives represent what we aim for most days, not every single day without exception. The journey to better sleep isn't about perfection - it's about progress. On difficult days, remind yourself of how far you've come rather than focusing on today's challenges. Every parent experiences setbacks during sleep training, and these moments don't erase the progress you've made. Be gentle with yourself when things don't go as planned.

Keep our guiding principle in mind: flexible routine, not rigid schedule. Life inevitably presents situations that require adaptation, and that's completely appropriate. My definition of success isn't adhering to a perfect schedule or achieving a perfectly consolidated nap every single day. Rather, success means your child develops healthy sleep skills, enjoys restful sleep, maintains a happy disposition, and you possess effective strategies to implement when needed. The goal isn't creating a good sleeper merely for the sake of having a good sleeper—it's enabling your entire family to thrive through better rest. You absolutely have the capability to achieve this.

I want you to trust your parenting instincts, celebrate every small victory along the way, and know that you're doing an incredible job. Even on the hardest days - especially on the hardest days - remind yourself that this challenging period is temporary, but the healthy sleep habits you're building will benefit your child for years to come. Your dedication, your consistency, and your love are making a profound difference.

Common Questions About Baby Sleep

Sleep Environment and Transitions

"What changes do I need to make when beginning sleep training?"

When you start your sleep training journey, some essential transitions might be necessary. If your little one is still swaddled or sleeping in a bassinet, it's time for a change. I know this can feel like a big step - these familiar sleep aids have likely been part of your routine for months! But I promise, your baby is ready for this transition, and you are too.

For safety during sleep training, you'll want to:

Switch from swaddling to a sleep sack (even if your baby isn't rolling yet)

Move from a bassinet to a crib or play yard

Ensure the sleep space follows safe sleep guidelines (firm mattress, no loose bedding)

If you're already using products like Merlin's Magic Sleep Suit, you can continue with these. The detailed transition guides in your resource materials offer step-by-step support for making these changes smoothly.

Remember, these transitions are positive steps in your baby's development. Though they might feel challenging at first, you'll be amazed at how quickly your little one adapts with your consistent, loving support.

"My baby has started rolling onto their tummy during sleep. Should I be concerned?"

Always place your baby on their back to sleep initially - this remains the safest starting position for the first year. However, once your baby can roll independently, most pediatricians agree it's completely safe for them to sleep in this position, as long as they aren't swaddled and their crib is free of loose bedding or toys.

The ability to roll actually signals an important developmental milestone. When your baby can roll over, they typically have the strength to lift and turn their head, which significantly reduces any risks associated with tummy sleeping. If you're using a proper sleep sack that allows arm movement and have a firm crib mattress without extras, you're following safe sleep practices.

I understand it can be unsettling to see your baby on their tummy on the monitor, especially if they occasionally press their face into the mattress. This behavior is actually quite common and not usually cause for concern with proper sleep surfaces. Babies often enjoy this sensation, and crib mattresses are designed to allow adequate airflow.

If you find yourself worrying, you can gently reposition your baby's head to the side, but try to resist constantly flipping them back over, as this can disrupt their sleep and prevent them from practicing self-settling. Instead, ensure they get plenty of supervised tummy time during awake periods to strengthen those important muscles.

As with any sleep concern, if you have lingering worries, your pediatrician is your best resource for personalized reassurance.

Managing Sleep Disruptions

"How do we handle developmental leaps and new skills that affect sleep?"

Those infamous "sleep regressions" often coincide with exciting developmental milestones. When your baby is mastering new skills like sitting, crawling, or language development, sleep patterns may temporarily change. This doesn't mean your sleep training efforts were wasted - your baby hasn't forgotten how to sleep! They're simply experiencing significant cognitive and physical growth that can temporarily disrupt sleep patterns.

Before assuming a regression is developmental, always check for physical discomfort. Ask yourself: Does my baby seem congested? Are they eating normally? Could they be teething? If you suspect your baby might not be feeling well, check with their doctor first.

Once you've confirmed your little one is healthy, return to your sleep training foundations:

Ensure the room passes the darkness test (you can't see your hand in front of your face)

Use appropriate white noise

Maintain a comfortable room temperature

Follow appropriate wake windows for your baby's age

During these developmental periods, consistency becomes even more important. Stick with your CALM Method routine and avoid introducing new sleep habits during this challenging phase. Your calm, confident approach helps your baby understand that "sleep is still important for your growing body."

Remember, these developmental disruptions are temporary. Your patience and consistency during these phases are building your baby's long-term sleep skills. Each time you work through a regression, you're strengthening your baby's ability to adapt to change - an important life skill!

"What if my baby gets sick or is teething?"

When your little one isn't feeling well, their comfort must become your absolute priority. This is one time when it's completely appropriate to pause sleep training temporarily.

For illness:

Take a complete break from formal sleep training and focus entirely on comfort and healing

Have your baby examined by their pediatrician, even for mild symptoms like congestion or unusual irritability

Once your baby has fully recovered, gradually return to your sleep routine

Know that offering extra support during illness is perfectly normal and won't undo your progress

For teething:

If you can see a white tooth emerging under the gums or clear signs of discomfort, you might pause formal training for 24-48 hours

The most intense discomfort usually happens when the tooth actually breaks through

For babies over six months, consult your pediatrician about appropriate pain relief like Motrin (ibuprofen)

For younger babies, Tylenol might be recommended (always confirm dosages with your doctor)

Avoid teething necklaces, which aren't recommended by pediatricians, especially during sleep

Trust your parental instincts during these challenging times. If something seems unusual about your baby's condition, never hesitate to consult with their doctor. Your loving response during times of discomfort actually strengthens your bond and teaches your baby they can count on you when needed.

Troubleshooting Nap Challenges

"Why are my baby's naps still so short?"

Short naps (less than 45 minutes) can be one of the most frustrating sleep challenges for parents. Before assuming something is wrong with your approach, remember that nap consolidation is a developmental skill that takes time to mature.

Start by investigating these common causes:

Sleep Environment Factors

Is the room truly dark enough? (Can you pass the hand test?)

Is the white noise consistent and set to the right volume?

Is the room temperature comfortable?

Are you using classic white noise rather than nature sounds?

Timing and Scheduling Issues

Are night sleep problems affecting daytime naps? (Sometimes resolving night sleep first improves naps)

Are wake windows appropriate for your baby's age and development?

Are feedings happening too close to nap time or in drowsy conditions?

Does your baby fall asleep within 1-3 minutes of being placed in the crib? (This might indicate overtiredness)

Sleep Association Factors

If you use a pacifier, are you replacing it during naps? (This can sometimes disrupt sleep cycle transitions)

The most important thing to remember with short naps is that consistency is your best friend. Pick one adjustment to try and stick with it for at least a full week before making additional changes. This patience gives your baby time to adapt and you time to properly evaluate what's working.

It's also worth noting that younger babies (especially under 7 months) naturally have more variable nap lengths. As your baby's sleep cycles mature, those naps will naturally consolidate. Your consistent approach is laying the groundwork for this development.

Even on days with short naps, maintain appropriate wake windows rather than rushing the next nap. This helps build proper sleep pressure and avoids creating a cycle of short wake times followed by short naps.

"How do I handle nap refusals?"

Even the best nappers occasionally refuse sleep, and this concern is completely natural. The good news is that complete nap refusal rarely persists beyond a brief period—the situation is almost never as challenging as we imagine it might be.

If your baby refuses a nap, here's a compassionate approach:

First Attempt: Allow up to 70 minutes for the initial nap attempt, which gives plenty of opportunity to practice independent sleep skills. If sleep doesn't happen within this timeframe: 

Enter calmly

Turn on lights

Switch off sound machine

Use a matter-of-fact tone to announce nap time is over

Give a hug and move to a brightly lit area

Reset Period: Provide 30-45 minutes of engaging, stimulating activity. This isn't a punishment but a chance to: 

Connect with your baby

Play together

Get fresh air if possible

Reset for another attempt

Your positive attitude during this time makes all the difference! If offering a snack during this period, keep your baby fully alert to preserve sleep pressure.

Second Attempt: Try again with a brief 3-5 minute nap routine, limiting this window to 35-45 minutes. Most babies who refuse the first attempt will fall asleep during this second opportunity.

If Still No Sleep: If the second attempt isn't successful, maintain your positive approach. Never show disappointment – your baby is working hard to develop these skills. After another brief period of quality awake time (about 30 minutes), transition to an assisted nap through holding, rocking, or whatever safely helps your baby sleep.

Remember, at this point, preventing overtiredness becomes the priority. Your baby has already practiced independent sleep skills extensively; now they simply need rest. Tomorrow brings another opportunity to practice these developing skills.

The most important thing is maintaining your calm, positive demeanor throughout this process. How you handle these challenging moments teaches your child important lessons about emotional regulation that extend far beyond sleep habits.

Managing Real-Life Situations

"How do I handle naps while traveling or on the go?"

Life with babies involves movement! While we aim for most naps to happen in optimal conditions, the reality includes car naps, stroller naps, and travel days. Here's how to manage these situations without undoing your hard work:

For Car or Stroller Naps:

Brief naps (less than 30 minutes) usually aren't fully restorative

If your baby wakes when you stop moving, you have options: 

If they transition well, move them to the crib

If not, consider extending the journey (driving a bit longer or walking more) to stretch a 15-minute doze into a more substantial nap

For very brief naps (10-20 minutes), wake them completely upon arrival and extend the next wake window by 20-40 minutes

During Travel:

Bring familiar sleep cues: portable sound machine, sleep sack, even a crib sheet

Accept that schedules will likely differ on travel days

Aim for approximately 70% of naps in proper sleep spaces, while allowing up to 30% flexibility for on-the-go situations

Adjust bedtime as needed—when naps are compromised, an earlier bedtime helps compensate

Remember that travel disruptions are temporary—your established routine will help reset things when you return home

When traveling with your baby, give yourself grace! Perfect naps aren't the goal - enjoying your time together while meeting your baby's basic sleep needs is. Your baby won't forget their sleep skills during a brief deviation from routine.

"What about daycare or regular schedule conflicts?"

For parents whose babies attend daycare or have regular schedule conflicts (like school pickups), I understand there are many factors outside your direct control. But here's what you can influence:

For Daycare Babies:

Maintain your own consistent approach during home days (dark room, sound machine, appropriate wake windows)

Accept that daycare will likely follow a different schedule - babies are remarkably adaptable to different environments

Control bedtime based on the day's sleep quality - consider an earlier bedtime (as early as 6:00 p.m.) on days with less optimal naps

Manage the commute home strategically - either wake a briefly napping baby completely or extend the journey to lengthen sleep

Communicate your baby's sleep goals with providers, but recognize their expertise with managing multiple children

For Regular Schedule Conflicts:

If your baby falls asleep during necessary travel, consider taking a scenic route

Explore arriving slightly earlier or waiting briefly after activities

Consider arranging carpooling help or asking trusted friends/family to assist during challenging time periods

Adjusting morning wake time by 30 minutes might naturally shift the day's schedule to better accommodate commitments

Remember, you're looking for balance between your baby's sleep needs and your family's necessary routines. Perfect adherence to ideal nap times isn't realistic for most families - and that's completely okay!

Understanding Sleep Schedules

"Why don't you recommend fixed nap times?"

While clock-based schedules might seem simpler, they often don't account for the biological reality of how sleep works. Quality sleep depends on properly building sleep pressure, which varies based on:

Your baby's age

When they last woke up

How long their previous naps were

Their individual sleep needs

For example, a baby waking at 6:00 a.m. versus 7:30 a.m. would need entirely different timing for their first nap. Similarly, a short first nap versus a long one significantly impacts when the next nap should happen.

As your baby matures (especially after transitioning to one nap, typically between 12-18 months), nap times may naturally become more predictable. However, until your baby demonstrates these consistent patterns, focusing on appropriate wake windows rather than rigid clock times usually produces better results.

This approach might seem less convenient initially, but it actually gives you more flexibility to adapt to your baby's changing needs while still providing structure. Think of wake windows as guardrails rather than railroad tracks - they guide your day while allowing natural adaptation.

"How do I resolve early morning wakings?"

Those 4:30 a.m. wakings can be incredibly challenging for parents! Early morning wakings (between 4:00-6:00 a.m.) often indicate that adjustments are needed in your daytime schedule. Here's how to address them:

Smart Scheduling Strategies:

Begin counting the first wake window from 6:00 a.m., not the actual wake time (If your baby wakes at 5:00 a.m. and you're targeting a 2-hour wake window, the first nap starts at 8:00 a.m.)

Examine the final wake window of the day - if it's too long, it can lead to overtiredness

Look for signs of chronic overtiredness - aim for the shorter end of age-appropriate wake window ranges

Consider an earlier bedtime (6:00-6:30 p.m.) during transition periods

Ensure your baby is falling asleep independently at bedtime, as this skill helps with those early morning periods when sleep drive is naturally lower

Remember that any adjustments need time to work - give each change at least 5-7 days, sometimes up to three weeks, before evaluating its effectiveness. Change just one variable at a time to avoid creating new issues.

Interestingly, persistent early morning wakings can sometimes indicate that a nap transition is approaching. If you've tried these approaches without success, it might be worth exploring whether your baby is ready to transition to fewer naps.

Special Circumstances

"How do we implement sleep training with twins or multiples?"

Parents of multiples - you absolutely deserve special recognition! The good news is that all the principles in this program apply equally to families with twins or higher-order multiples, with some thoughtful adaptations:

Creating Suitable Sleep Spaces:

Ideally, each baby should have their own crib or play yard during formal training

If possible, create separate sleep areas (even temporarily using different rooms)

Ensure each space has the same sleep conditions: darkness, cool temperature, sound machine

Coordinating Routines:

Try to begin nap routines within approximately 10 minutes of each other

It's perfectly acceptable if one baby needs an extra 10-15 minutes to build sleep pressure

Work toward synchronized schedules when developmentally appropriate, but don't force it

Providing Support:

When using check-in methods like two-by-two or 15-by-15, you can address both babies simultaneously

If one baby consistently needs additional support, consider positioning that crib closer to the door

Remember that each baby is an individual with unique sleep needs. Though having a synchronized schedule is convenient, respecting each child's developmental timeline is more important. The investment you're making now in establishing healthy sleep habits will bring tremendous benefits to your entire family.

"What if we just have an occasional 'off' day?"

Even the best sleepers have challenging days occasionally! When naps aren't going as expected, try these approaches:

Give extra settling time if your baby seems to need it

Wait 15-25 minutes after a short nap before intervening (they might reconnect sleep cycles independently)

Check for physical discomfort like illness, congestion, or teething

Try especially engaging activities during wake times (outdoor time often works wonders)

Consider an earlier bedtime (around 6:00 p.m.) or a brief assisted "cat nap" to compensate for missed sleep

The most important thing to remember is that a single difficult day doesn't erase all your progress. Consistency over time builds a strong sleeper. Every parent experiences occasional challenging days - it's part of the journey, not a sign of failure!

Visualizing Progress and Success

As we wrap up these common questions, I want to remind you of what success actually looks like. It's not about achieving perfect naps every single day or following a rigid schedule without deviation. True success means:

Your baby develops healthy sleep skills that serve them throughout childhood

They enjoy restful, restorative sleep most of the time

You have effective strategies to implement when challenges arise

Your entire family thrives through better rest

The journey to great sleep isn't always linear. There will be amazing days when everything goes perfectly, and challenging days that test your patience. Both are normal and expected parts of the process.

What matters most is your consistent, loving approach to supporting your baby's sleep development. Each time you respond with patience and consistency, you're building not just sleep skills, but your child's sense of security and your own parenting confidence.

Remember that countless parents have walked this path before you and found success, even when it seemed impossible. You are stronger and more capable than you realize. I believe in you completely, and I'm here to support you every step of the way!

Navigating Sleep Challenges

Where to Kick Off

Hey there! Welcome to Navigating Sleep Challenges. I'm so excited you're here. This section is for all you amazing parents who are at least a month past sleep training. What we're going to do together is take everything you've learned in both the Sleepy Little One and Understanding Naps programs and combine it with what you know about your unique little one. Because guess what? You're about to become your baby's personal sleep expert! And yes, that's absolutely possible because nobody – and I mean nobody – knows your baby better than you do.

I created this bonus resource to walk you through the most common challenges and show you exactly what to do when you hit them. But it's so much more than that. As you watch these videos, I want you to see how these principles can apply to literally any challenge your baby faces. My goal is for you to navigate the next two years with confidence, no matter what comes your way. So let's dive in together, shall we?

Finding Your Balance: The 70-30 Approach to Baby Sleep

I want you to picture something with me. Imagine a playground seesaw. On one end sits a family with such a rigid sleep schedule that they never, ever miss a crib nap, their baby never stays up past 7:00 PM, and they literally plan their entire existence around this sleep schedule. On the other end? Complete chaos – no consistent routine, bedtimes all over the place, and everyone's exhausted.

Neither of these extremes creates a happy family life, right? What we're aiming for is that sweet spot in the middle – balance.

Here's what's amazing about your well-rested baby with healthy sleep skills: they're not fragile! They're actually more adaptable than a chronically overtired baby. Think about it – they understand how to fall asleep independently, which gives them (and you!) the fundamental ability to handle life's occasional curveballs.

You know what I see happen all the time though? Parents who are so afraid to disrupt the schedule that they never practice any flexibility. Then when life inevitably throws something their way – a pet suddenly needing urgent care, or an unexpected phone call from work, or – surprise! – a new sibling arrives... it feels completely catastrophic. Without practicing those small adaptations, both you and your baby struggle when changes are necessary.

Let me explain this with a household example we can all relate to. You know those kitchen sponges that get stiff when they dry out? If you try to bend a bone-dry sponge, it just cracks, right? But if you keep it slightly flexible with a bit of moisture, it can bend without breaking. Your baby's sleep routine is exactly like that! It needs to maintain its basic structure but with enough flexibility that it can adapt when needed.

So how much flexibility is appropriate? I recommend what I lovingly call the 70-30 approach: about 70% of the time, maintain your core sleep routine. Naps happen in the crib at predictable times, and bedtime follows your established pattern. The other 30% is where real life happens.

Let me make this super practical for you. Let's say you have an 8-month-old taking two naps daily. That's 14 naps and 7 bedtimes each week. Using our 70-30 guideline, about 4-5 naps and 2 bedtimes can flex without undermining your baby's sleep foundation.

So what might this look like in real life? Maybe on Tuesday, you're dying for adult conversation so you take a stroller walk during naptime to meet a friend for coffee. On Thursday, you need to grab groceries, so baby takes a shorter car nap while running errands. Saturday night, grandparents are in town and want to put the baby down while you and your partner grab dinner. And Sunday, your family always gets together for dinner, so bedtime shifts later.

Can you feel the breathing room this approach gives you? Let's zoom in on that Sunday evening example. Your small group meets every Sunday, and bedtime shifts to 8:30 PM instead of 7:00 PM. If every other night follows your usual routine, this occasional adaptation is healthy balance in action! Your baby's core sleep needs are being met while allowing your family to actually live your life.

Now, I need to speak directly to the perfectionists for a minute. I see you there, getting anxious just thinking about deviating from the schedule! Maybe your heart rate picked up a bit, or you're thinking, "But we worked so hard to get here!" I totally understand. Sleep loss was brutal, and now you finally have a good sleeper. The thought of doing anything that might mess that up is terrifying.

But here's the truth: you won't go back to those dark days because now you have two things you didn't have before – a solid plan to rely on and a baby with actual sleep skills. Before, you were navigating life with a baby who didn't know how to sleep well. That's not your reality anymore! You can loosen your grip on the perfect schedule because if things start to slide, you know exactly how to course correct.

Remember, the ultimate goal isn't perfect adherence to an inflexible schedule. It's creating a sustainable rhythm that works for your entire family – a well-rested, adaptable child and parents who can actually engage with the world beyond the nursery walls. That's what thriving looks like!

Finding Your Rhythm: Getting Back on Track

So, has your sleep success story encountered a setback? Maybe the flu decided to make a grand tour through your entire household. Or perhaps you just returned from that cross-country trip to visit family. Maybe you've weathered some big changes – a move, a job transition – or maybe the holidays completely turned your routine upside down.

First things first: take a deep breath with me. Right now. Seriously, do it!

You haven't failed, and neither has your little one. Life happened—and that's not just okay, it's completely normal and expected. Even the families with the best sleepers experience setbacks. The difference isn't whether the setbacks happen; it's knowing how to find your way back.

I'm going to give you four practical steps to help you rediscover your rhythm—and trust me when I say, you've absolutely got this!

1. Give Grace and Space

The first step is to allow the dust to settle a bit. Your little one needs a few days to readjust after disruption. It's like when you come back from vacation and your entire system feels out of whack – your baby feels that too!

If they've been sick, give their body time to fully recover before expecting perfect sleep. After holidays or travel with time changes, their internal clock needs some time to reset. This isn't about lowering your expectations—it's about being realistic and kind.

I like to think of it like this: imagine if you ran a marathon and then someone expected you to be at your desk working at peak performance the very next day. Sounds unreasonable, right? Your child is human, just like you. When you give them this grace period, you're not giving up—you're setting the stage for success by acknowledging that sometimes we all need a little extra support, and that's perfectly okay.

2. Return to Your Foundation

If a few days have passed and sleep is still challenging, it's time to gently return to your Sleepy Little One plan. I want to emphasize something important here—this isn't starting from scratch! Those sleep skills your baby worked so hard to develop are still there, just a bit rusty. It's like riding a bike after a long winter break – the knowledge is there, but the muscles need a reminder.

Let's revisit the core elements:

Begin with baby fully awake in the crib: If you've gradually drifted back to rocking, feeding, or snuggling to sleep, it's time to return to placing your little one in the crib while they're still awake. You want to see those little eyes open when you place them down. That's your goal. You taught them this skill once—they'll remember it again, and probably faster than the first time!

Be present and supportive: You're still in this together, just like before. Those comfort checks that worked during initial training? They still work! Pop in, offer a quick reassurance with your voice for no more than 15 seconds per visit. I know your baby may protest differently now—maybe they have more words or can even stand up and bounce in the crib—but your calm presence remains their anchor.

I want you to think of yourself as that cool-as-a-cucumber flight attendant during turbulence. You know the type – the plane is bouncing around, and there they are, calmly pouring apple juice like it's just another Tuesday. Your baby is looking to you to know whether to panic. If you walk in steady and confident, they'll feel reassured even as they protest.

Review nighttime nutrition: If extra feedings crept in during your off-track period, it might be time to gently eliminate these again. Most of these feedings were added for comfort rather than true hunger. For babies who are now getting significant calories at night, return to your gradual night weaning plan over the next 3-5 nights. Trust your parental instincts here—you know the difference between comfort-seeking and true hunger.

Restore daytime structure: Remember that 6:00 a.m. is still your "line in the sand" for starting the day. If morning cuddles in your bed have become the new normal, let's go back to your early post-sleep-training approach—bring baby into a bright, well-lit living room to signal the start of the day. Throughout the day, keep an eye on those wake windows and try to be home for at least 70% of naps.

Each time you reinforce these fundamentals, you're reminding your little one that they have the beautiful ability to sleep independently. You're not teaching something new—you're helping them rediscover what they already know. Think of it like playing a song they haven't heard in a while – they might be rusty on the first verse, but by the chorus, they're singing along!

3. Reconnect with Your "Why"

When nights are especially challenging, it's easy to lose sight of your original motivation. Take a moment to reflect on what drives you and jot down that core reason. Remember: without your "why," the path becomes unclear. So, ask yourself—what fuels your determination to keep moving forward? Maybe those difficult nights were creating chaos in your home. Maybe you know everyone functions better with proper rest. Maybe you've noticed how sleep affects your baby's mood and development.

Let me remind you of some powerful truths: babies who sleep well perform better socially, emotionally, physically, and cognitively. Parents who sleep better experience fewer incidents of depression, anxiety, and relationship struggles. And most importantly, well-rested families share stronger emotional bonds throughout the day.

This isn't lightweight stuff! Write down your why, put it somewhere you can see it (maybe tape it to the nursery door!), and speak it aloud when things get tough. This isn't just about tonight's sleep—it's about the quality of your family life for years to come. You're investing in something truly precious.

4. Trust the Process (And Yourself!)

Your great little sleeper will return soon—I absolutely promise. The skills your baby learned during sleep training haven't disappeared; they're simply waiting to be practiced again. It's like when you take a break from exercise – those muscles are still there, they just need a little wake-up call!

Yes, your baby may have discovered that other options exist during your disruption. "Oh, so rocking to sleep is back on the menu?" But with your guidance, they'll quickly remember that sleeping independently in their crib is actually the most restorative option.

Maintain that calm, confident presence. Your energy sets the tone for the entire process—when you project certainty, your baby feels secure. You've navigated this path before, and you can absolutely do it again. In fact, I find that most families see getting back on track happens much faster than the initial training!

When you're 100% consistent, what I typically see is one or two tough nights, maybe one or two middle-of-the-road nights, and then – boom! – you're back to normal. You're so much closer than you think to having your well-rested family back.

Your Road Back to Restful Nights

Let's recap your action plan:

Allow a few extra days—be gentle with both your little one and yourself.

Revisit the basic principles of your sleep strategy.

Jot down your core motivation and speak it aloud during difficult times.

Have faith that both your little one's peaceful sleep and your confidence as a parent will soon be restored.

With consistent implementation, most families see results quickly! You might have one or two difficult nights where you question everything, followed by one or two nights that are better but not perfect, and then—sleep normalizes! You're so close to having your well-rested family back.

Stay the course—you've done the hard work already, and your little one hasn't forgotten. If you find yourself struggling after a full week of consistency, remember that additional support is just a phone consultation away. You don't have to figure this out alone.

You've got this, parent. Your commitment to healthy sleep is one of the greatest gifts you're giving your child—and your whole family. Before you know it, you'll all be sleeping soundly again.

Navigating Nighttime Wake-Ups

Has your champion sleeper suddenly started waking at night? Take a deep breath—you haven't lost all your progress. When a baby who's been consistently sleeping through the night for weeks or months unexpectedly begins waking, I want you to remember this important truth: sleep skills don't simply vanish overnight.

Your little one hasn't forgotten how to sleep, and you haven't failed as a parent. When dramatic changes happen, it's time to put on your detective hat and investigate. Let's walk through this together—you've got all the tools to solve this mystery!

First, Rule Out Physical Discomfort

Whenever sleep suddenly deteriorates, always check for pain or illness before adjusting sleep habits. Trust your parental instincts here—you know your baby better than anyone.

Did you know that disrupted sleep is often the first sign of an ear infection before other symptoms even appear? I've seen this countless times—baby starts waking when they've been sleeping through, and two days later, the ear infection becomes obvious. Don't hesitate to call your pediatrician for an ear check if something feels off to you. If illness is present, pause sleep training concerns and focus completely on comfort and health.

Also consider: Has your baby experienced any previous medical issues—for instance, a history of eczema or reflux? Could there be a flare-up happening? Maybe a medication adjustment is needed—your doctor can help with this.

Your baby's health and comfort always take priority before addressing any sleep habits. Remember, you're being a responsive, attentive parent by considering these factors. This isn't "giving in"—it's good parenting!

Examine the Sleep Environment

If health seems good, turn your detective skills to the environment. Even small changes can have a big impact on your little one's sleep!

Has the season changed recently? I had one family whose baby started waking every night in October. The mystery? Their heater had kicked on for the season, and the room was now too warm! What about light exposure? With seasonal changes or time shifts, the light in the room might have changed, or your blackout solutions may have become less effective.

During nap time or early morning, step into your baby's room and assess the lighting conditions. If you can easily make out details like printed text or subtle textures, the brightness might be too intense for a peaceful sleep environment. Look for any unexpected sources of light—perhaps a digital clock display or a soft LED on a gadget you hadn't considered. Even these minor illuminations can unsettle a sensitive sleeper.

Also, check your ambient noise device. Is it churning out white noise at a level comparable to a busy coffee shop or a lively street? Sometimes, settings can change unintentionally, making the noise more intrusive than before.

Take a few minutes to verify all these elements, then create a Room Check to ensure the optimal sleep environment. Creating the right sleep space isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a gift you're giving your baby and yourself!

Revisit Your Sleep Plan Fundamentals

After checking for discomfort and environmental factors, let's examine the sleep plan basics. It's completely normal for routines to drift over time—we're all human!

Have bedtimes gradually crept later, consistently happening after 8:00 p.m.? Are most naps happening on the go rather than in the crib? If this sounds familiar, it's time to gently reestablish crib sleeping and that sweet spot bedtime.

Think about your bedtime routine: Has drowsy feeding become part of the picture again? Is your little one zoning out during breast or bottle feeding? I call this "the sneaky sleep crutch" because it can creep back in so quietly. Try moving the bedtime feeding to the beginning of the routine to prevent drowsiness during feeding.

Another common pattern I see is that parents gradually start placing baby in the crib when they're too drowsy or nearly asleep. For some strong sleepers, this doesn't cause immediate issues—which is why you might have gotten away with it for a while! But over time, it accumulates, resulting in a baby who needs more help during nighttime wakings.

Remember that your goal is crib entry while fully awake. Also, reflect on how you've been handling those night wakings. Are they addressed with a quick comfort check followed by a return to sleep, or have you found yourself lingering and removing baby from the crib?

If any of this resonates with you, returning to your plan basics is the most direct path to resolving these night wakings. You've succeeded with these strategies before—you can absolutely do it again!

Adjust to Your Growing Baby

If illness isn't present, the sleep environment is perfect, and you've maintained consistency with the basics, next examine the daytime routine. Sudden night wakings may simply indicate it's time to adjust wake windows—your baby is growing and developing every day!

As babies grow, they need more time and activity to properly fill their sleep battery. It's like how you needed more food as a teenager than you did as a child—their sleep needs change too! Consider gradually adding more awake time to each wake window—or even transitioning to fewer naps if appropriate.

For example, let's say your 7-month-old has been on a 2/2.25/2.5 wake window schedule, but suddenly starts waking at night. You might need to stretch to 2.25/2.5/2.75 to ensure they're truly tired enough at bedtime.

Review the master plan for your baby's age and the nap transition resources in the downloads. Just remember not to rush into a nap transition unless you're seeing consistent signs that your baby is ready. Jumping the gun can create more problems than it solves!

Conversely, if you recently completed a major nap transition, perhaps the wake windows are now too long for your little one. Finding the right balance takes some experimentation, and that's perfectly normal. You're learning and adapting along with your baby—that's what makes you a wonderful, responsive parent.

Conquering Early Risings

If you're watching this section, I want to start by saying: I see you. Having your day start at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. is incredibly challenging. It typically means beginning with tears and frustration—for both you and your baby. You're not alone in this struggle, and there is hope for better mornings ahead.

Early risings (those wakings between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.) are usually the very last aspect of sleep training to be conquered, and they present unique challenges. Here's why:

Bodies have had nearly a full night of rest, so sleep pressure is lower

Natural melatonin levels are dropping as morning approaches

The sun is rising, allowing light to penetrate even the best blackout solutions

Although more sleep is needed, all these factors work against your baby. It's like trying to fall back asleep after you've gotten up to use the bathroom at 5 a.m. – technically you could use more sleep, but your body might have other ideas!

During the first month of sleep training, follow your plan consistently—don't deviate. This isn't yet the time to begin troubleshooting. Often, early in sleep training, consistency is the magic key to reaching that golden 6:00 a.m. or later wake-up time.

If a month or more has passed since sleep training began, the secret to conquering those early mornings is identifying the root cause—which frequently lies in the daytime routine. But for a Sleepy Little, here are some key strategies to help you reclaim your mornings:

1. Place Baby Awake in the Crib at Bedtime

Make sure that bedtime consistently involves putting your baby in the crib fully awake. This might seem unrelated to early mornings, but it's actually crucial! If your baby becomes too drowsy or falls asleep within one to three minutes of being placed in the crib, they're not developing the independent sleep skills needed to manage those challenging early morning hours when sleep conditions aren't ideal.

Think of it like learning to ride a bike with training wheels versus without them. If you only practice with training wheels, you never develop the balancing skills needed for the real thing. Bedtime is your baby's practice ground for managing those early morning wake-ups.

2. Fine-Tune Your Bedtime Routine

Consider moving the bedtime feeding to the beginning of the routine or making bedtime 10 minutes earlier to ensure you clearly see your baby's eyes open when placed in the crib. These small adjustments can make a significant difference in helping your little one develop those crucial independent sleep skills.

I had one family whose 8-month-old was waking every day at 5 a.m. We realized that mom was feeding baby so close to bedtime that he was falling asleep within two minutes of being placed in the crib. Just by moving that feeding to the start of the routine, they gained a full hour in the morning within three days!

3. Hold Firm to 6:00 a.m.

This is perhaps the most challenging part, but it's also the most important: do not remove your baby from the crib before 6:00 a.m. Whether you're using comfort checks or customized interventions, drawing a firm line at 6:00 a.m. is crucial for long-term success.

Starting the day before 6:00 a.m. reinforces those early morning wakings. It's like your body's internal alarm clock – what time you get up today affects what time you'll wake tomorrow. Decide that crib time continues until 6:00 a.m. each morning, and stay consistent with this boundary. I promise that with patience and consistency, your baby will begin sleeping until that time.

4. Examine the Daytime Routine

If you're struggling with early morning wakings, check whether your wake window consistently begins too early. For instance, if waking occurs at 5:30 a.m., but you start your day then, you're accidentally setting a pattern.

Instead, adjust your routine so that wake windows begin at 6:00 a.m. regardless of when your baby actually woke up. Also, review the final wake window of the day: if it's too long, try shortening it slightly to prevent overtiredness at bedtime.

For example, if your baby's bedtime wake window should be 3 hours but you've stretched to 3.5 hours because you were running errands, that extra 30 minutes might be causing overtiredness that leads to early waking.

5. Address Potential Overtiredness

A chronically overtired baby may experience more early morning wakings. If naps are consistently short, consider offering an assisted nap during the day to help achieve a long, consolidated period of sleep. Think of this as a reset button for your baby's sleep tank.

While a bedtime as early as 6:00 to 6:30 p.m. can be acceptable during transitions, consistently putting a baby to bed before 7:00 p.m. may predispose them to wake too early. Finding your family's ideal bedtime sweet spot might take some experimentation, and that's perfectly normal.

6. Promote True Independent Sleep

Ensure genuine independent sleep at bedtime. If you find yourself rocking, walking, or bouncing your baby completely to sleep—or if sleep occurs within just one to three minutes of crib placement—your little one might not be developing the necessary independent sleep skills for managing those challenging early morning hours.

This isn't about being less loving or responsive—it's about giving your baby the opportunity to develop the self-regulation skills they need for quality sleep. Review the Sleepy Little One program for additional tips on fostering true independent sleep.

Be Patient With the Process

Finally, remember that any changes you implement should be maintained for at least five to seven days (and sometimes up to 21 days) to truly determine effectiveness. Try to change only one variable at a time, since making multiple changes simultaneously can create additional challenges.

I worked with one family whose baby was waking at 5 a.m. every day for weeks. They wanted to try three different approaches all at once! I convinced them to start with just extending the afternoon wake window by 15 minutes. Within four days, baby was sleeping until 6:15 a.m. Patience and methodical changes often win the race!

One more consideration: early morning wakings can also signal that it's time for a nap transition. Check the download resources to see if that might apply to your baby's age and development stage.

Remember that you're not alone in this journey. If struggles continue despite your best efforts, a phone consultation can be added to your course. Support is always available—no parent should face this challenge alone.

You're doing important work by helping your little one develop healthy sleep habits. Better mornings are ahead, and soon you'll all be waking rested and ready for the day—at a reasonable hour!

Navigating Attachment Milestones with Confidence

Has your once-content baby started clinging to you like a little koala? Are there suddenly more tears or even full meltdowns when you step out of the room? Before you worry that something's wrong, let me offer you a completely different perspective: congratulations! You're witnessing one of the most beautiful developmental milestones—separation anxiety.

While these new behaviors can certainly be challenging (and yes, sometimes truly exhausting), what's happening is actually a normal, healthy part of your baby's development that demonstrates secure attachment. Your little one is learning something profound about how the world works—they're beginning to understand that people and objects exist even when out of sight. This concept, called object permanence, is a major cognitive breakthrough!

When you walk around a corner, your baby now realizes you still exist somewhere, even if they can't see you. Those tears at departure simply mean they miss you and want you close—not that you've done something wrong or that your bond is troubled. In fact, it's quite the opposite! Those big feelings are evidence of the beautiful connection you've built together.

It's like my friend Sarah who worried when her 9-month-old daughter suddenly couldn't bear to let her out of sight. "What am I doing wrong?" she asked me. I explained that her daughter's distress was actually a sign of how secure their attachment was – her baby loved her so much that being separated felt genuinely upsetting! Understanding this completely changed Sarah's perspective on those tearful goodbyes.

When to Expect This Phase

Separation anxiety can begin as early as four to six months and typically peaks between eight and 10 months, with another surge around 14 to 18 months. Many parents notice sleep disruptions during these developmental leaps—and that's perfectly normal.

Remember, your baby hasn't lost their sleep skills overnight! They're just processing new emotions and understandings about the world, which can temporarily impact their sleep. This phase will pass, and you have the tools to navigate it with confidence.

Reframing the Challenge

Consider this everyday scenario: If every time you handed your baby to another caregiver so you could shower, they became upset—crying, arching their back, or having a full meltdown—would you stop showering until this phase passed?

Of course not! You would reassure yourself that your baby is safe and secure with the other caregiver, and then proceed with your necessary self-care. The same principle applies at nap time and bedtime. Your baby is safe, and these routines are actually wonderful opportunities to show them that you always return—building their trust in both you and the world around them.

I like to think of it as giving your baby practice with an important life skill. Each successful separation and reunion strengthens their confidence that relationships can withstand temporary distance. It's a foundation they'll use throughout life!

Your Toolkit for Managing Separation Anxiety

Let's review some practical do's and don'ts when your little one is experiencing separation anxiety. These strategies can transform challenging moments into opportunities for growth:

Don't Sneak Away

Avoid: Leaving quietly to prevent tears—this can actually increase anxiety over time

Instead: Create a simple, consistent goodbye ritual. Offer a hug and kiss, and let your baby know you're leaving with a simple phrase like, "I love you; I'll be back soon."

Years ago, I worked with a family whose mom would literally crawl out of the nursery on her hands and knees to avoid being seen leaving! While this prevented immediate tears, their baby's separation anxiety got worse because she never got to practice saying goodbye and experiencing reunion. Once they created a simple, loving goodbye ritual, their baby learned that goodbyes were okay because mommy always came back.

Don't Get Overly Emotional

Avoid: Displaying excessive sadness or frustration when leaving, as babies mirror our emotions

Instead: Remain calm and confident in your voice and body language, reassuring your baby that everything is okay. Your steady presence is their anchor.

Think of yourself as their emotional compass. If you seem worried about leaving them, they'll think, "If mom's worried, I should be too!" Your confidence communicates safety.

Don't Linger

Avoid: Hovering or lingering at the door, which can actually heighten anxiety

Instead: Keep departures brief and matter-of-fact. If necessary, use quick comfort checks (about 15 seconds) for reassurance, then leave. Brief goodbyes are often less stressful than prolonged ones.

I always tell parents to think of it like removing a bandaid – quick and decisive is usually less painful than slow and drawn-out!

Do Have Intentional Periods of Separation

If working outside the home: Take advantage of these natural separations to help your baby practice the emotional skill of saying goodbye and experiencing reunion

If at home full-time: Consider scheduling short periods away (perhaps a one-hour walk with a trusted friend or family member) to help your baby practice the separation/reunion cycle in a controlled way

I worked with one stay-at-home mom who never left her baby except at sleep times, and then wondered why bedtime was so difficult! Starting with just 30 minutes twice a week at the gym childcare made a huge difference in her baby's ability to handle bedtime separations.

Do Be Intentional During Playtime

Engage in games: Play peek-a-boo or hide a favorite toy under a blanket to help reinforce understanding of object permanence in a fun, low-stress way

These playful moments build the cognitive foundation that helps your baby understand you still exist when out of sight

One creative mom I worked with took photos of herself and laminated them, then let her baby hold the picture during brief separations. This visual reminder that mommy still existed somewhere was incredibly comforting to her 10-month-old!

Applying These Principles to Sleep Times

Now, let's apply these guidelines specifically to sleep situations, which can be particularly challenging during phases of separation anxiety:

At Bedtime and Nap Time:

Continue putting your baby down awake in the crib—even though it might seem easier to rock to sleep during this phase. Rocking all the way to sleep might reduce tears at bedtime, but can actually increase anxiety upon waking, as it feels to your baby like someone mysteriously disappeared.

Maintain a consistent goodbye ritual as part of your bedtime or nap routine. This predictability is incredibly reassuring and helps your baby feel that everything is safe and as it should be.

Stay calm and offer gentle validation: You might say something like, "I know you don't want me to leave right now, but your body needs rest. I'll be back soon." Your confident tone communicates that this separation is normal and safe.

If a comfort check is needed for reassurance, keep it brief—around 15 seconds—and then leave. Remember that your goal is to reassure, not to restimulate.

Remember: consistency in these routines builds trust and reinforces that even though you leave, you always return. Each successful separation and reunion strengthens your baby's confidence in both themselves and in you.

A Real-Life Example

Let me share a quick story that might help: When my nephew began experiencing separation anxiety around nine months, my sister made sure goodbyes were quick and direct—getting down to his level, offering a hug, making eye contact, and saying, "I love you, I have to go now, but I will come back soon."

Later, when he became anxious in a store after momentarily losing sight of her, a quick reassurance of "It's okay, I'm right here—I can see you" helped immediately calm his fears.

Moments like these remind us that our words truly matter to our little ones, even before they can speak themselves. Speak truth to your baby, honor their emotions while remaining their steady guide, and someday those same reassuring words will be echoed back to you.

You're doing important work during this phase—helping your baby build the emotional foundation they'll carry throughout life. These challenging moments are actually precious opportunities to teach your little one that the world is a safe place where loved ones may leave, but they always come back. That's a powerful gift that goes far beyond sleep training.

Navigating Developmental Leaps: Understanding "Sleep Regressions"

If you've spent any time searching online about baby sleep, you've probably come across the term "sleep regression." These are typically described as occurring around four months, eight to 10 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months—those times when your once-peaceful sleeper suddenly seems to forget how to sleep.

But here's what I want you to know: these aren't actually regressions at all. They're progressions—beautiful, important developmental leaps that occasionally disrupt sleep. During these periods, your little one is busy mastering new skills and processing incredible bodily and brain changes. Their mind is literally expanding with new abilities!

It's like when you're so excited about a new hobby that you stay up too late doing it. Remember getting a new video game or book as a kid and being too excited to sleep? That's your baby with their new skills! Their brain is buzzing with activity, making it harder to settle down.

I know it doesn't always feel wonderful when you're facing multiple night wakings again, but I want to reassure you: your good sleeper hasn't disappeared. Those sleep skills you've worked so hard to develop are still there, just temporarily masked by all the exciting development happening.

Reframing the Challenge

Instead of worrying about a "regression" (a word that implies moving backward), let's focus on what's actually happening. Ask yourself:

What specific changes am I noticing in my baby's sleep?

When did this shift begin?

Are there any new skills my baby is working on right now?

Have there been any changes to our routine or environment?

This approach helps you address the actual situation rather than falling into the trap of thinking all your hard work has vanished overnight. I promise you—it hasn't!

I remember working with Melissa, whose 8-month-old son had been sleeping 11 hours straight every night since completing sleep training at 5 months. Suddenly, he started waking 2-3 times each night, crying until she came in. Melissa was devastated, thinking all their hard work was undone. But when I asked what else was happening, she lit up: "Oh! He just started crawling this week, and he's trying to pull up on everything!" Mystery solved! His brain was simply too busy processing these exciting new skills to settle easily at night.

First Things First: Rule Out Physical Discomfort

If sleep suddenly deteriorates, your first step should always be to check for any physical causes. Your parental intuition is powerful here—trust it! Here's a quick checklist:

Check for signs of illness: Does your baby have a fever, congestion, or seem unusually fussy? Even a mild cold can disrupt sleep patterns.

Watch for ear infections: Sudden night wakings with intense crying can sometimes signal an ear infection before other symptoms appear. One mom I worked with couldn't figure out why her baby suddenly started screaming every time she laid her down. A quick doctor visit revealed a double ear infection, even though she had no fever!

Consider chronic conditions: If your baby has eczema, reflux, or other ongoing medical concerns, could they be experiencing a flare-up? Changes in weather, diet, or growth can trigger these conditions.

Milestone development: Is your baby working on rolling, sitting, crawling, pulling up, or walking? These physical milestones often temporarily impact sleep as babies practice their new skills day and night! Think of it as your baby doing "homework" after hours.

Separation anxiety: If bedtime has suddenly become a tearful affair, review the separation anxiety section for specific guidance. Remember, this is a cognitive leap, not a sleep problem!

Teething discomfort: Those little teeth pushing through can definitely disrupt sleep—check for drooling, fussiness, or red, swollen gums.

Remember: This Is Temporary

Here's what I want you to write down and post somewhere visible: "This is a phase, not a forever."

It's perfectly normal for sleep to feel somewhat challenging during these developmental leaps. Your baby might take longer to fall asleep at naptime, or there might be more movement and babbling in the crib at bedtime. You might hear more brief cries throughout the night as your baby transitions between sleep cycles.

These fluctuations are expected and normal. The key during these periods isn't to overhaul your entire approach—it's to trust your sleep plan and remain consistent with the fundamentals you've established. Your consistency provides security for your baby during these times of rapid change.

I like to compare it to driving through a rainstorm. You don't change cars when it starts raining—you just turn on your wipers and headlights and keep going. The same vehicle that got you through sunny days will get you through storms too, with minor adjustments!

Back to Basics

When sleep seems disrupted, focus on reinforcing the basics rather than assuming all sleep skills have disappeared:

Check the environment: Is the room still dark enough? Is the white noise at the right volume? Has the temperature changed with the seasons? I had one family whose baby started waking at 3am every night after they installed a new streetlight outside the nursery—the light was seeping through a gap in the curtains!

Assess wake windows: As babies grow, they often need slightly longer wake periods. A wake window that was perfect last month might be too short now. Try extending by 15 minutes and see if that helps.

Ensure active awake time: During developmental leaps, babies need plenty of opportunity to practice their new skills during the day so they're less compelled to work on them at night. When Jenny's son was learning to pull up, she created a "pulling station" with safe furniture for him to practice on throughout the day. The more he practiced during the day, the less he needed to "practice" at 2am!

Return to your sleep plan: The foundational approaches that helped your baby learn to sleep well initially are the same ones that will help during these transitions. Consistency is your best friend here.

Personalized Problem-Solving

Take a moment to get specific about what you're noticing. Is it fighting naps? Early morning wakings? Midnight parties? Multiple night wakings? Once you've identified exactly what's challenging about your baby's sleep right now, find the section in this program that most closely matches your situation.

If nothing seems to fit exactly and sleep continues to be difficult after 5-7 days of consistency, the "Getting Back on Track" section offers comprehensive guidance to reset your sleep foundation.

Remember that you don't have to navigate this alone. We're here to support you through every phase of your baby's development.

The incredible little sleeper you've nurtured is still there, I promise. These developmental leaps are just part of the journey—and they're actually signs that your baby is growing and thriving exactly as they should be. You've got this, and better sleep is just around the corner!

Supporting Your Baby Through Illness

When your little one is sick, everything changes—and that's exactly as it should be. During illness, your primary focus should be on comfort and healing, not sleep training. Watching your baby struggle with discomfort can be truly heartbreaking, and it's not only natural but necessary to provide that extra support they need.

I remember when my neighbor's perfectly sleep-trained 9-month-old caught her first stomach bug. This mama was so worried about "undoing" all their hard work that she tried to stick to their usual routine. But you know what? Both mom and baby ended up exhausted and miserable. When she finally gave herself permission to respond fully to her baby's needs—holding her for naps, bringing her into bed when necessary—not only did her baby recover faster, but they easily returned to independent sleep once the illness passed.

Remember this: responding with compassion during illness doesn't undo all your hard work. In fact, being responsive when your baby truly needs you actually strengthens their sense of security, which ultimately supports healthy sleep in the long run.

When Your Baby Is Genuinely Sick:

Press pause on formal sleep training and focus entirely on comfort and healing. This is exactly what a responsive, loving parent should do. Your baby isn't manipulating you—they're genuinely uncomfortable and need your help.

Have your baby examined by their pediatrician for proper diagnosis and treatment. Trust your instincts—you know your baby better than anyone. That small voice inside saying "something's not right" is worth listening to!

Provide any necessary medications as recommended by your doctor, following dosage instructions carefully. Some medications might make your baby drowsy, while others (like some decongestants) can actually make them more alert—good information to have when planning sleep.

Expect increased needs during this time. Your baby may want more frequent feedings, extra cuddles, or need help falling back asleep throughout the night. This is temporary, and meeting these needs now won't create long-term dependencies.

Think of it like this: when you're sick, don't you appreciate a little extra TLC? Your normal independence doesn't disappear when someone brings you soup or checks on you more often. The same is true for your baby!

When Recovery Begins:

Once symptoms have significantly improved, begin transitioning back to your sleep routine. Look for signs like improved appetite, more playfulness, and a return to normal energy levels. Your baby will give you clues when they're ready to return to independence.

Consider a gradual approach if your baby has become accustomed to more assistance. You might need to slowly reduce your presence rather than immediately returning to your full sleep training plan. For instance, if you've been rocking all the way to sleep, start by rocking until drowsy for a night or two before placing down awake.

Trust that temporary support during illness won't permanently erase all your progress. Your baby still remembers how to sleep independently—they just needed some extra help during a difficult time.

I worked with a family whose 11-month-old got a nasty ear infection right after they completed sleep training. For three nights, this little guy needed extra comfort, including being held upright to sleep due to ear pain. His parents were convinced they'd have to start from scratch, but once he was feeling better, he went right back to his crib without protest. Those sleep skills were still there, just temporarily overshadowed by physical discomfort.

Managing Teething Discomfort:

Check for visible signs: A tooth actually emerging through the gum or noticeably swollen, red gums are reliable indicators of active teething. Not every fussy night is teething—sometimes we're too quick to blame those pesky teeth!

Respond to genuine discomfort: If you notice clear signs of teething pain, you might consider temporarily adjusting your approach for 24-48 hours. The most intense discomfort typically occurs right when the tooth breaks through the gum.

Consult your pediatrician about appropriate pain relief: For babies over six months, your doctor might recommend infant ibuprofen. For younger babies, acetaminophen might be appropriate (always confirm proper dosages with your doctor).

Remember the nursing school wisdom: It's easier to stay ahead of pain than to chase it. If you know your baby is actively teething and uncomfortable, consider a dose of doctor-approved pain relief before bedtime rather than waiting for middle-of-the-night distress.

Avoid teething necklaces, which aren't recommended by pediatricians due to safety concerns, especially during sleep.

One creative mom I worked with used frozen, freshly-washed washcloths for her teething 14-month-old to chew on before naps and bedtime. The coolness soothed his sore gums, and the routine of "gum time" eventually evolved into a reliable sleep cue even after teething was over.

After Vaccinations:

Expect possible mild side effects after vaccines, including soreness at the injection site, mild fever, or general discomfort. These reactions actually show your baby's immune system is responding appropriately.

Remember that these effects are typically short-lived, usually lasting just 24-48 hours. This truly is a "phase, not a forever" situation.

Treat these symptoms similar to other mild illnesses, offering extra comfort and support as needed. Some babies don't seem affected at all, while others might need a little extra TLC.

Return to your regular sleep routine once your baby is feeling better. Most families find that any sleep disruption after vaccines is minimal and short-lived.

I always recommend scheduling vaccines in the morning when possible. This gives you the daytime hours to monitor any reactions and administer comfort measures, often resulting in a smoother night.

Transitioning Back to Your Sleep Plan:

Wait until your baby is genuinely feeling better—this might mean being completely symptom-free or significantly improved. There's no set timeline here; you're looking for your baby to be back to their normal, playful self.

Begin by reintroducing the consistent elements of your sleep routine, such as your bedtime ritual and consistent wake-up time. These familiar patterns signal a return to normalcy.

If new sleep associations were formed during the illness (like rocking to sleep or co-sleeping), you might need to gradually phase them out rather than making an abrupt change. Start by placing your baby in the crib drowsy but awake, then work back toward fully awake.

Be patient as you reestablish previous sleep patterns. It may take a few days, but you're not starting from scratch—you're simply refreshing skills your baby already has. Think of it as dusting off a bike after winter storage—the skill is still there, just needs a little practice!

Trust your parental instincts during these challenging times. If something seems unusual about your baby's condition, never hesitate to consult with their doctor. Your loving response during times of discomfort actually strengthens your bond and teaches your baby they can count on you when needed.

Remember, offering appropriate comfort during illness doesn't mean you've failed at sleep training—it means you're being exactly the parent your baby needs. A secure attachment is built not only through consistency but also through responsive care when your baby truly needs it.

Celebrating Motor Development (Without Losing Sleep)

Have you ever noticed how you sleep before a big job interview, your wedding day, or any significant life event? For many of us, sleep becomes disrupted when our minds are preoccupied with something exciting. That's exactly what happens when your baby is mastering a new skill!

In the first 12 to 18 months, your little one accomplishes countless remarkable milestones—learning to roll over, sit up, crawl, pull up, and walk. Each new skill represents a major achievement, and just like adults, babies can become so excited about their new abilities that sleep temporarily takes a backseat.

I remember when my friend's daughter learned to pull up to standing. This little girl was so thrilled with her new perspective on the world that she'd wake up at 3 a.m., stand in her crib, and just bounce up and down, grinning in the dark! She wasn't unhappy—she was literally too excited to sleep!

These exciting developmental leaps often mean that when you put your baby down to sleep, they might be eager to practice what they've just learned. "I just figured out how to stand up. I need to do it again... and again... and again!" The crib often becomes the perfect practice space—the one place where your baby has the freedom to explore these new skills without interference.

While this is absolutely thrilling for your baby (and a sign of healthy development!), it might result in longer time to fall asleep or more frequent night wakings. Don't worry—this phase is temporary, and there are ways to support your little one through it.

Practical Strategies for Motor Milestone Phases:

Be Intentional with Active Awake Time

Maximize floor time during your baby's waking hours. This is one of the five key ingredients for active awake time—along with feeding, fresh air, interaction, and independent exploration.

Give plenty of opportunities to practice new skills during the day. The more your baby practices during active play, the less compelling it will be to turn the crib into a midnight practice zone.

One mom I worked with created what she called "Body Bootcamp" for her 10-month-old who was learning to stand and cruise. Three times a day, she'd set up different surfaces and objects for him to pull up on and practice with. She swore this 15-minute activity helped "get the wiggles out" before naptime!

Remember: A tired body falls asleep more easily than a rested one that hasn't burned off its energy!

Use a Sleep Sack Strategically

At bedtime and naptime, a sleep sack not only signals that it's time to sleep but also makes certain movements (like standing or crawling) a bit more challenging.

This gentle restriction can help discourage using the crib as a practice space while still allowing necessary movement.

Think of it as creating a boundary between active play time and rest time. It's like how you might change into comfy clothes after work to signal to your body that it's relaxation time!

One family I worked with had a baby who kept trying to crawl in her crib during naptime. Switching to a sleep sack with feet coverage reduced the traction she could get, making crawling less appealing and sleep more enticing!

Assess Your Baby's Emotional State

Ask yourself, "Is my baby actually unhappy or just practicing?" If your little one seems content after some active time in the crib, it's often best to let them settle themselves. Even if it takes a little longer to fall asleep, a well-filled sleep battery means they'll eventually get the rest they need.

If you notice your baby is stuck or uncomfortable—for example, if they've just learned to roll onto their tummy but can't roll back—offer a brief, supportive comfort check. Instead of immediately repositioning them, try patting their bottom and gently rubbing their back to help them settle into the position.

Remember: Your calm presence reassures them that this new position is okay.

Support During Nighttime Transitions

Occasionally, the new skill might create a genuine physical need in the middle of the night. For instance, if your baby has just learned to pull up but isn't yet able to sit back down safely, use a quick comfort check to help ease them into a sitting position before laying them back down.

Continue with your established sleep plan. Remember, it typically only takes a few nights for your baby to adjust as long as you remain consistent and avoid introducing new sleep crutches.

I worked with a dad whose 11-month-old son had just learned to stand but couldn't figure out how to sit back down. For three nights, dad would go in when his son got stuck standing, gently guide his hands to the mattress, and help him sit before laying down. By the fourth night, his son had figured out the maneuver on his own!

Keep in mind: just because your baby is learning something new doesn't automatically mean that sleep will deteriorate. Often, the best approach is to maintain your sleep plan and trust that your baby will integrate this new skill into their repertoire relatively quickly.

When a challenging night occurs, remind yourself that you've navigated sleep hurdles before and you can do it again. These developmental milestones are cause for celebration—they're signs that your baby is growing and thriving exactly as they should be.

This phase will pass, and sleep will return to normal. In the meantime, enjoy witnessing the marvel of your baby's developing abilities. You're doing an amazing job supporting their growth while maintaining healthy sleep foundations.

Enjoying Family Vacations Without Sleep Disasters

If you're at least a month past sleep training and considering travel, this section is for you! Perhaps your baby has become such a champion sleeper that you're hesitant to change anything. Maybe the thought of taking a vacation feels overwhelming—what if it ruins all your hard work?

Here's an important truth to remember: You completed sleep training so life could be lived fully with a well-rested family—not to create rigid adherence to rules that prevent you from making memories. Take the vacation. Visit family and friends. Create those precious experiences together.

Will traveling with a baby go perfectly? Probably not! There will likely be some disrupted sleep and unexpected challenges. But go anyway. These experiences are valuable for your whole family, and a baby who has solid sleep skills will return to being a good sleeper once you're back home.

I remember chatting with Maria, who was so nervous about taking her 10-month-old to the beach for a family reunion. She almost backed out because she worried about ruining her daughter's sleep schedule. They went, and yes, sleep was a bit disrupted. But you know what Maria told me after? "Those memories of my daughter feeling sand between her toes for the first time – I would have regretted missing that forever. And after a couple days back home, she was sleeping great again!"

Let me give you some practical strategies to set yourself up for the best possible sleep while traveling:

Before You Leave:

Start with a Well-Rested Baby

The week before vacation can be hectic with packing and preparations. Make a conscious effort to prioritize naps and maintain normal bedtimes during this time.

A well-rested baby will be more adaptable to the changes that come with travel. Think of it as building up their sleep bank before withdrawing from it.

It's like making sure your phone is fully charged before a day of heavy use. You know you'll be drawing on that battery more than usual, so start with a full charge!

Plan Travel-Friendly Sleep Arrangements

When booking accommodations, check if there's a separate space where your baby can sleep. One family I worked with would specifically request rooms at the end of hotel hallways, away from elevator noise and with more wall space for creative crib placement.

For hotel stays, consider booking a suite if possible. If that's not in your budget, many families have successfully used a well-ventilated bathroom as a temporary sleep space (just remove any unsafe items and make it comfortable).

When visiting family or friends, have a conversation in advance about where your baby might sleep independently. Being proactive helps avoid last-minute scrambling.

I worked with one creative family who brought their Pack and Play to a hotel that only had a standard room available. They created a makeshift room divider using the ironing board and a blanket draped over it! Their baby couldn't see them from the crib, which prevented the "middle-of-the-night party" that often happens when babies spot their parents.

Pack Your Sleep Essentials

Bring along items that help recreate your home sleep environment: your sound machine, familiar sleep sacks, and your baby's favorite lovey if they use one.

Consider packing portable blackout solutions like travel blackout blinds or even heavy-duty garbage bags and painter's tape in a pinch! One mom I know travels with binder clips and a dark sheet – she can quickly create blackout curtains in almost any room.

Don't forget any special comfort items that are part of your routine, such as a specific book or small toy.

Remember Jessica who was traveling to her in-laws? She forgot her baby's sound machine and spent the first night playing white noise from her phone. The next day, she found a small fan at a local store that created similar background noise. Being adaptable with your solutions is key to successful travel!

During Your Trip:

Maintain Core Routines

While timing might shift, try to keep the sequence of your sleep routine consistent. Those familiar steps signal to your baby that sleep time is approaching.

Prioritize at least one good nap per day if possible. This helps prevent the overtiredness that can make bedtime more challenging.

Think of your routine as your baby's roadmap to sleep. Even if you're in a different place, the familiar sequence of steps helps them understand what's coming next.

Be Flexible But Intentional

Accept that some sleep disruption is inevitable and part of the adventure! The sooner you make peace with this, the more you'll enjoy your trip.

Try to balance flexibility with structure. Perhaps some naps happen on the go, but aim for proper crib naps when possible.

Remember the 70/30 rule: if you can maintain good sleep habits 70% of the time, the other 30% can be flexible without derailing your progress.

I worked with a family traveling to Disney World with their 9-month-old. They planned most days around getting back to the hotel for an afternoon nap, but one day they stayed out for the parade. Their baby took a stroller nap, and though it was shorter than normal, they planned for an earlier bedtime that night to compensate. Being strategic with your flexibility makes a huge difference!

Create a Sleep-Friendly Space

In unfamiliar environments, do your best to make the sleep space as dark and quiet as possible. Use bathroom fans or your sound machine to mask unfamiliar noises.

Maintain a consistent temperature if possible, as being too hot or cold can disrupt sleep.

If room-sharing with your baby, consider creating a visual barrier with a sheet over a chair or a travel crib positioned strategically.

One family on a road trip realized their hotel room was right by a noisy ice machine. They moved their Pack and Play to the side of the room furthest from the noise and placed a chair with their coats draped over it to create a sound buffer. Creative problem-solving is your best friend while traveling!

When You Return Home:

Expect an Adjustment Period

Give your family at least a few days to resettle into normal routines. Don't schedule important events right after returning if possible.

You might need to be a bit more consistent with your sleep plan for the first week back.

Trust that your baby remembers how to sleep well—those skills don't disappear after a vacation!

I often tell parents to think of coming home from vacation like a washing machine cycle. There might be some agitation at first as everyone readjusts, but then things settle back into rhythm. Most babies are back to their normal sleep patterns within 2-3 days of returning home.

Remember that these special family times are worth temporary sleep disruptions. The memories you create together far outweigh the brief setback in sleep that might occur. And the confidence you gain from successfully navigating travel with your baby will make future adventures even easier!

Your little one is more adaptable than you might think, especially with the solid sleep foundation you've already established. So pack those bags, take lots of pictures, and enjoy this special time together. You've done the hard work of sleep training—now it's time to enjoy the freedom it was meant to give you!

Adding Another Baby

Congratulations, you're having another baby! I know this time is filled with excitement and possibly a lot of questions too. As your sweet baby eases into the role of big brother or big sister, I want to give you my best tips to set your whole family up for sleep success.

First, let me introduce you to the magic number three. Here's why it's so important: We want to avoid any major life changes within three months before or three months after your new baby's arrival. Becoming a big sibling is already a huge transition, and we don't want to pile on any unnecessary stress.

Think of it like this: If you were starting a challenging new job, would you also want to move houses, start a new diet, and join a competitive sports team the same month? Of course not! You'd space out those big life changes to give yourself time to adjust to each one. Your toddler needs that same consideration.

This means we're going to hold off on transitioning out of the crib, ditching the pacifier, potty training, or tackling any other big developmental changes that are within your control. Each of these transitions deserves its own time and attention, not to be rushed alongside welcoming a new family member.

I worked with a family who decided to move their 18-month-old to a toddler bed just two weeks before their second baby arrived. The result? A toddler who suddenly wouldn't stay in bed, was overtired and emotional, and really struggling with the new baby's arrival. When we moved him back to his crib, his sleep and daytime behavior improved dramatically, even with the new baby at home.

Also, parents, I want to remind you of something important: that new baby probably won't need a crib for the first four to six months. So you don't need to evict your older child from the crib simply because the baby is coming. Transitioning out of the crib too early is one of the biggest causes of toddler sleep issues, and trust me, you don't need toddler sleep problems when you've got a newborn!

So what are your options? You could buy a second crib if your budget allows, use a bassinet for the baby while your toddler keeps the crib, or borrow a crib from a friend. Just don't rush your toddler out unless they're truly showing signs they're ready for a bed.

Now, let's talk about three key things you can do for your older child once the baby arrives:

1. Get Outside Every Day (If Possible)

I know it sounds simple, but getting outside daily can work wonders for everyone's mood and sleep. Here's why I recommend this:

It's good for YOU. Exposure to natural light helps regulate your hormones and can reduce postpartum depression. Even 15 minutes makes a difference.

It's one of the five F's for healthy awake time - Fresh air promotes better sleep for both your babies.

Research shows that children who are exposed to daylight sleep better at night. The natural light helps set their internal clocks.

It gives your toddler a chance to burn energy in a positive way, making them more likely to sleep well.

One mom I worked with made a simple "outdoor scavenger hunt" with her 2-year-old while wearing her newborn. It became their special daily ritual - finding a red leaf, spotting a bird, feeling something rough - and both children napped beautifully afterward!

If weather makes going outside impossible, at least open those curtains and sit by the window. Natural light is powerful medicine for the whole family.

2. Create Special One-on-One Time

Each day, set aside at least 15 minutes for special and intentional face-to-face time with your older child. This isn't about elaborate activities - it's about connection.

Set your phone down and give your child your undivided attention. This matters more than what you actually do together.

Do something that babies can't do. Color a picture, build with blocks, share a special snack, or read a "big kid" book. This reinforces their special "big kid" status.

Be explicit about how special this time is for you. Say things like, "I just love our puzzle time together. You're so good at puzzles!" or "This is my favorite part of my day!"

Talk about this special time throughout the day. "After lunch, we'll have our special time together. Should we color or build today?"

This consistent, focused attention fills their emotional bucket and reduces the jealousy and attention-seeking behaviors that often disrupt sleep after a new baby arrives.

Jen, a mom I worked with, created a "big brother box" that only came out during the baby's first morning feeding. It contained special toys that only her son could play with while sitting next to her as she fed the baby. He actually looked forward to the baby's feedings because it meant special time with mom and his exclusive toys!

3. Maintain a Consistent Bedtime Routine

With so many things changing in your toddler's world, a familiar bedtime routine provides security and predictability. It says, "In a changing world, some important things stay the same."

If right now, during your pregnancy, you're the only one who does the bedtime routine, it's time to get your partner or another caregiver involved. You want your child to know that either parent (or grandparent, etc.) can handle bedtime successfully.

Start by having the other adult join you for the routine, then gradually hand over parts of it. Maybe tonight your partner reads the story while you do the final tuck-in. Next week, they handle the whole second half of the routine. The goal is flexibility before the baby arrives.

I remember working with a dad who had never put his 18-month-old to bed because mom always handled it. When their second baby came and mom was busy with a feeding, bedtime became a tear-filled disaster. We worked on gradually involving dad in the routine during the last month of pregnancy, and by the time baby arrived, their toddler was completely comfortable with either parent handling bedtime.

For the bedtime routine after your baby arrives, you might need to simplify, but try to maintain the core elements. Maybe bath time becomes every other night instead of nightly, or you read two books instead of three. The key is keeping the sequence familiar and consistent.

Baby-wearing can be incredibly helpful during this time if you're handling bedtime solo. Your newborn can snuggle against you while your hands are free to help your toddler brush teeth, read stories, and tuck in.

To recap our key strategies:

No major life changes three months before or after baby arrives

Focus on three things daily: getting outside if possible, having special one-on-one time with your older child, and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine

Remember that your older child can stay in the crib if they're not showing signs of readiness to transition

One final thought: be prepared for some changes in both awake time behavior and sleep behavior. This is perfectly normal! Your older child is processing a huge life change, and some behavioral shifts are to be expected. Remember, little ones thrive on loving boundaries. Maintain consistent limits with empathy, especially around sleep times.

A well-rested toddler will make your adjustment to life with two children so much easier. One mom told me, "I can handle almost any toddler meltdown if I've had decent sleep. It's when we're both overtired that things fall apart."

Before I go, let me remind you: You've got this! There's no better parent on the planet for those babies than you. Your family will find its new rhythm, and before long, you'll wonder how you ever lived without both of these incredible little people in your life.

Navigating the Crib-to-Bed Transition

I'm guessing you're watching this because you've got a little escape artist on your hands! Don't worry, you're not alone. Let's talk about your options when your little one starts climbing out of the crib.

You essentially have two choices: find ways to keep them safely in the crib, or transition to a bed. I'll be honest with you – my recommendation is to keep your little one in the crib as long as you safely can. Let me explain why.

The number one cause of toddler sleep problems between 18 months and two and a half years is transitioning out of the crib too early. Here's the thing: if your toddler is younger than two and a half, they simply don't have the developmental capacity and impulse control to stay in bed. Their brain literally isn't wired for that kind of self-regulation yet!

It's like expecting a 9-month-old to use silverware properly. Could they hold a spoon? Sure. Would you expect them to use it correctly without making a mess? Of course not! The same principle applies to staying in a bed – the physical ability to get out doesn't mean they have the developmental capacity to choose not to.

Also, when toddlers come out of the crib, a whole new set of safety concerns emerges. That crib has been keeping them safely contained during sleep hours. Once they're in a bed, they can wander freely – to stairs, bathrooms, kitchens, or wherever else their curiosity leads them.

So let's talk about how to keep them safely in the crib if possible:

Step 1: Create a Safer Crib Environment

First, lower your baby's crib mattress to the absolute lowest position possible. Sometimes there's even an extra notch that you didn't use before. Check the manufacturer's instructions to be sure you're at the very bottom setting.

Next, try turning the crib around. Many cribs are designed with the front side slightly lower than the back. By turning the crib so the higher side faces outward, you create a taller barrier to climb over. This simple switch has saved many families from an early transition!

Also, consider positioning the crib strategically in the room. Pushing it into a corner means two sides are blocked by walls, leaving fewer options for climbing out. Just be sure there's no furniture nearby that could be used as a step.

I worked with a family whose 22-month-old had started climbing out daily. Simply by lowering the mattress to the very bottom, turning the crib around, and moving it to a corner, they bought themselves six more months of crib use. Those six months made a huge difference in their toddler's readiness for a bed when the time finally came.

Step 2: Use a Sleep Sack

Sleep sacks are your secret weapon when combating crib escapees! These wearable blankets serve two important purposes:

They restrict leg movement just enough to make climbing more difficult

They make it harder for little toes to grip the crib slats

Look for sleep sacks that cover the feet or have a slightly snugger fit around the legs (while still being safe and comfortable, of course). 

One creative mom I worked with cut the feet out of footed pajamas and put them on her toddler underneath a regular sleep sack. This gave her little climber a soft, slippery surface instead of grippy toes to scale the crib with!

Step 3: Catch Them in Action

If you have a video or two-way monitor, try to catch your little one in the act of attempting an escape. When you see them starting to climb, use your monitor's talk feature to give a firm, clear "NO" instruction.

For some children, this immediate feedback is startling enough to discourage future attempts. It's like they suddenly realize, "Oh! Mom can see me even when she's not here!" This won't work for every child, but it's worth trying before moving to a bed.

The father of twins I worked with recorded his own voice saying "Please lie down in your crib" and would play it through the monitor when he saw climbing attempts. The kids thought it was magical that daddy "knew" what they were doing!

If you've tried all these strategies and your little climber is still escaping, it's probably time to transition to a bed. Safety always comes first – if they're climbing out despite your best efforts, the risk of injury from a fall is greater than the challenges of an early bed transition.

Making the Transition to a Bed

When moving to a bed, your toddler's entire room becomes their "crib." This means the whole nursery must be completely childproofed:

Furniture must be securely anchored to walls

Outlets should be covered

Cords (especially from blinds or monitors) must be out of reach

Dressers should have drawer stops

Consider removing toys that might become tempting middle-of-the-night distractions

Make sure doors and gates are secure

I recommend doing a "crawl test" – get down on your hands and knees and look at the room from your child's level. You'll spot hazards you might miss from adult height!

You'll also need to decide how to contain your toddler safely in their room. Some families install a baby gate at the door, while others use doorknob covers or door alarms. The goal is preventing unsupervised nighttime wandering while creating a safe space for them to play if they wake early.

Jane, a mom I worked with, created what she called a "yes space" in her daughter's room – the entire room was so thoroughly childproofed that if her daughter got up at 5 a.m., she could safely play until morning wake-up time without requiring immediate supervision.

Adapting Your Sleep Plan for a Bed

Hey everyone, if you’re dealing with a little escape artist at home, don’t worry—you’re definitely not alone! When your toddler starts climbing out of the crib, you really have two options. You can either tweak the crib setup to keep them safe or transition them to a bed. Let’s chat about both choices and share some practical tips.

Option 1: Keeping the Crib a Safe Space

Why Stick with the Crib?

You might wonder, “Why not just move on to a bed?” Well, many sleep problems in toddlers, especially those between 18 months and 2½ years, come from transitioning too early. At this age, they often don’t have the impulse control to stay safely in bed, and a crib naturally keeps them contained and minimizes risks like falls or wandering.

How Can You Make the Crib Safer?

Lower the Mattress:

Adjust the mattress to its lowest setting. If you notice your toddler trying to climb out, a lower mattress might just do the trick.

Reposition the Crib:

Some cribs have one side that’s lower than the other. Try turning the crib so the shorter side is against the wall—that way, it’s harder for your little one to climb. Another idea is to tuck the crib into a corner, which blocks off several sides.

Use a Sleep Sack:

A sleep sack can really help. It limits leg movement and, if it covers the feet, stops them from gripping the crib’s edge.

For example, one family I know had a toddler who was climbing out all the time. Once they lowered the mattress, turned the crib with the lower side against the wall, and started using a sleep sack, the climbing nearly stopped over the next few nights..

Option 2: Transitioning to a Bed

If you’ve tried every trick and your child continues to climb out, it may be time to move on. A bed offers more freedom but requires a few safety adjustments since the room itself becomes the new “crib.”

Creating a Safe Room Environment:

Childproofing the Room: Ensure that furniture is secured to the wall, all electrical outlets are covered, and cords or other hazards are out of reach. For example, use outlet covers and cable organizers to keep dangerous items away from your toddler’s hands.

Containment Strategies: If your child tends to wander, consider installing a door alarm or safety gate to gently alert you when they leave the room.

Establishing a Consistent Sleep Routine:

Falling Asleep Awake: Just as in the crib, teach your toddler to go to sleep while still awake. This builds independent sleep habits.

Stay Calm on Exits: When your toddler leaves the bed, maintain a calm demeanor. Walk them back with minimal interaction and a quiet reminder like, “It’s bedtime, please stay in your room.” Expect to repeat this several times, especially during the first few nights. For example, one parent reported needing to guide their child back about 15–20 times on the first night, with the number decreasing steadily as the new routine took hold.

Maintain Nap Times: Don’t let the bed transition disrupt daytime routines. Keep naps consistent, as most children need them until at least age three.

Whether your child eventually falls asleep in the bed or occasionally dozes off on the floor, safety remains the primary goal. The sleep habits they’ve built in the crib are not lost with the change of furniture; they’re simply being adapted to a new environment.

Navigating Potty Training While Protecting Sleep

Are you thinking about potty training? For some families, potty training happens in these first two years because their little ones show clear signs of readiness. For others (like my own kiddos!), it's simply not time to begin yet.

Let me be clear - this section isn't here to pressure you into potty training before your little one is ready, nor is it meant to make you hold off if they're showing all the signs. It's simply a resource for those of you who've decided it's time to begin, so you can protect all that great sleep you've worked so hard to establish.

I always tell parents that good sleep should come before potty training. Why? Because a well-rested child is more emotionally regulated, better able to learn new skills, and generally more cooperative. Starting potty training with a strong sleeper makes the process smoother for everyone!

That said, even our champion sleepers might have some disruptions during potty training. Just like any new skill, learning to use the potty can temporarily impact sleep. But don't worry - that sleep foundation is still there, and you can keep using your sleep plan to stay consistent throughout this transition.

Day vs. Night Training: They Don't Have to Happen Together

One of the most important things to understand is that daytime and nighttime potty training don't need to happen simultaneously. They actually involve different developmental processes, and your child might be ready for one long before the other.

Some children master daytime potty use as early as 18-24 months, but their bodies aren't physiologically ready to stay dry all night until 3, 4, or even 5 years old! This is completely normal and has to do with the development of hormones that reduce urine production during sleep.

I worked with Emma, whose 2.5-year-old daughter was completely potty trained during the day within a week. Emma assumed nighttime would follow quickly, but after two weeks of disrupted sleep and wet beds, we decided to use pull-ups at night while continuing daytime training. Her daughter stayed in nighttime pull-ups for another year before her body was ready for night training - and that's perfectly normal!

The bottom line: allowing your child to conquer each aspect at their own pace benefits everyone's sleep and reduces frustration. You know your little one best, so follow their cues about readiness.

Practical Sleep-Protecting Strategies During Potty Training

If you've decided to move forward with potty training, here are some ways to minimize sleep disruption:

Limit fluids before sleep: Try to reduce drinking in the 45-60 minutes before nap or bedtime. Make sure they're well-hydrated earlier in the day, then taper off. Think of it like dimming the lights before bed - you're helping their body prepare for rest.

Handle accidents matter-of-factly: If your little one has an accident during sleep time, keep your response low-key. Use minimal lighting (a small nightlight is perfect), speak quietly, and keep conversation to a minimum. Your goal is to avoid making midnight bathroom trips stimulating or interesting.

I remember working with a dad who made the mistake of turning on all the lights and enthusiastically praising his son for waking up to pee. Guess what happened the next night? His son woke up every hour wanting to "practice" using the potty again! Keep middle-of-the-night potty trips boring and business-like.

Use sleep-specific protection: If you're focusing on daytime training but holding off on nights and naps, use terms like "night diaper" or "sleep pull-up" to distinguish from daytime underwear. This clear differentiation helps prevent confusion.

One clever mom I worked with called daytime underwear "awake undies" and pull-ups "sleeping undies." This distinction helped her daughter understand the different expectations without feeling like she was "going backward" at night.

The Crib Question: Do You Need a Toddler Bed for Potty Training?

Many parents assume they need to transition their toddler to a bed for potty training, but that's not necessarily true! If your child is under 2.5 years and sleeping well in a crib, I strongly recommend keeping them there if possible.

Even for night training, your toddler can call for you when they need to go, and you can help them. This preserves the safety and sleep boundaries of the crib while still responding to their potty needs.

Candice, whose 2-year-old son was showing all the signs of potty readiness, was worried about keeping him in his crib. We decided to potty train during the day while keeping the crib for sleep. She simply explained: "When you need to go potty during sleep time, call for Mommy or Daddy, and we'll come help you." It worked beautifully! He'd call out when needed (which was actually quite rare) and otherwise stayed happily in his crib for another eight months.

Remember, moving out of the crib too early is one of the biggest causes of toddler sleep issues. Don't rush this transition unless absolutely necessary.

Final Thoughts on Potty Training and Sleep

Keep these two important facts in mind:

Every child develops at their own pace. Your child will master potty use on their own timeline. Some are ready at 18 months, while others aren't interested until closer to 3 years. Both scenarios are completely normal.

You don't have to sacrifice good sleep to begin potty training. With thoughtful planning and appropriate expectations, you can support this milestone while protecting the healthy sleep habits you've established.

If you have any concerns about your child's potty training readiness or development, always check with your medical provider. They can provide personalized guidance based on your child's specific situation.

And remember, having a well-rested child actually makes potty training easier! A tired, cranky toddler is less able to listen, learn, and control their impulses - all crucial skills for successful potty training.

Life After Baby Turns One: What Changes and What Doesn't

So your baby turned one - happy birthday to your sweet little one! This milestone often comes with a flurry of questions about transitions and changes. Should you stop nursing? Is it time for one nap? Do you need to wean from the bottle or pacifier? Should you transition to a toddler bed?

I want to start with something really important: many of these transitions aren't mandatory just because your child had a birthday. You get to choose what's best for your unique child and family situation.

I remember talking with a mom who was stressing about weaning her 12-month-old from nursing because her mother-in-law told her "babies shouldn't nurse past their first birthday." But this mama loved nursing, her baby was thriving, and it was an important part of their connection. I reminded her there's no rule that says nursing must end at one year. In fact, the World Health Organization recommends nursing until at least age two!

The same goes for other transitions. I didn't wean my baby from nursing until he was over two and a half. Most little ones aren't developmentally ready for a toddler bed until at least two and a half. And despite what you might hear from well-meaning friends, most 12-month-olds aren't ready for just one nap yet.

The point is, there's no need to make drastic changes simply because your baby celebrated a birthday. Some transitions are inevitable, like moving to a different room at daycare or church nursery, but for changes within your control, you can time them based on your child's individual readiness, not an arbitrary date on the calendar.

Timing Transitions Thoughtfully

When you do decide to make changes, consider timing them thoughtfully. For example, if your baby is taking her first steps and working hard on walking, you might want to wait a few weeks before trying to transition from a bottle to a sippy cup. Learning multiple new skills simultaneously can overwhelm little ones.

Think of it like your own learning. Would you want to start a new job, learn a new language, and take up rock climbing all in the same week? Probably not! Give your child the gift of mastering one thing at a time when possible.

Sleep Changes You Might Notice

While not everything needs to change after the first birthday, there are some shifts in sleep patterns and approaches that often emerge during the second year:

Longer time to fall asleep: While babies under one typically fall asleep within about five to 20 minutes, toddlers often take 20 to 30 minutes to fall asleep at nap time and bedtime. This is completely normal and reflects their developing imagination and cognitive processing.

When they lie down, their growing brains are busy replaying their day, processing new words and experiences, and even engaging in early imaginative thinking. As long as they're content in their crib, this extended wind-down time is perfectly healthy.

Screen time becomes more impactful: As your child approaches and passes the one-year mark, screen time begins to have a stronger effect on sleep. Research shows screens can suppress melatonin production and overstimulate developing brains.

Try to eliminate screen exposure at least 60 minutes before sleep times, and carefully monitor content. What seems harmless to you might be stimulating or even a bit scary for a toddler's emerging imagination!

Naps remain important: Despite what your neighbor or family member might tell you, most children continue to need a daily nap until at least age three or four. A one-year-old typically still needs two naps, transitioning to one nap somewhere between 15-18 months for most children.

Let me share a quick snapshot of what a typical schedule might look like for a two-year-old:

Wake up around 6:30-7:00 AM

Nap from 12:30-2:30 PM

Bedtime between 7:00-7:30 PM

While we're gradually moving away from strict wake windows toward more clock-based timing, the average two-year-old does best with about 5.5-6 hours of wake time before nap and 4.5-5 hours between nap and bedtime.

Nap length varies widely at this age - some two-year-olds need three-hour naps while others do fine with 90 minutes. Watch your unique child and adjust within that normal range based on their needs.

Notice we're still aiming for that sweet spot 7:00-8:00 PM bedtime, which continues to be optimal through the toddler years.

Changes That Can Wait

Here are some transitions that don't need to happen right at age one, despite what you might hear:

Pacifier weaning: Unless your doctor has specific concerns, pacifiers can safely be used past the first birthday. Many sleep experts recommend waiting until around age two when children have more language and understanding to process the change.

Nightlights: Most little ones don't develop fear of the dark until between ages two and a half and three. Until your child actually verbalizes fear or concern about darkness, it's best to keep the sleep environment as dark as possible.

If you do introduce a nightlight later, choose one with red light rather than blue or white, as red light has the least impact on melatonin production

Transitioning from the crib: Most children aren't developmentally ready for a toddler bed until at least age two and a half. The crib provides important sleep boundaries that support quality rest for both your child and you!

Sleep sacks: These wonderful wearable blankets can and should continue well beyond the first birthday. They provide warmth without loose bedding and help discourage crib climbing. Sleep sacks come in sizes that fit children up to age four or five, and I typically recommend using them until your child transitions to a bed.

Pillows and blankets: Most healthcare specialists recommend waiting until at least 18 months before introducing a small pillow or lightweight blanket, but many children do fine without these until they move to a toddler bed.

Remaining Consistent

As your baby grows into a toddler, consistent expectations around sleep become even more important, not less. Clear boundaries around sleep times provide security and predictability for your growing child, even if they begin to protest more vocally!

Your steady, loving response to sleep resistance reminds them that sleep is not optional - it's an essential physical need that helps their growing bodies and developing brains. The confidence you project helps them feel secure, even as they test limits.

Remember, good sleep continues to be vital for cognitive development, emotional regulation, immune function, and growth throughout the toddler years. By maintaining healthy sleep habits now, you're setting your child up for a lifetime of good sleep hygiene.

Navigating Potty Problems: When Poop Disrupts Sleep

Is poop causing problems with your little one's sleep? I want you to know this is actually quite common, but don't worry - it's often a short-lived struggle with some straightforward solutions.

I know how frustrating it can be. Maybe your baby is waking early in the morning to poop, and once you change them, they refuse to go back to sleep. Or perhaps nap time keeps getting cut short because of mid-nap bowel movements. Maybe your little one is spending their "falling asleep" time pooping instead of drifting off. Whatever the pattern, let's talk through some practical ways to handle this.

I worked with Melissa, whose 14-month-old had started pooping exactly 10 minutes into every nap. She was at her wit's end because he'd then be uncomfortable, need changing, and wouldn't go back to sleep. We implemented some of the strategies I'm about to share, and within a week, his pooping pattern had shifted to after waking from naps instead!

Practical Solutions for Poop Problems

Protect that little bottom: Start by coating your baby's bottom with a thick layer of diaper cream before bedtime and nap time. This creates a protective barrier that shields their skin from irritation if they do poop during sleep. This way, if your baby happens to poop and you don't discover it immediately, their skin is less likely to become irritated.

Think of it like putting wax on your car before a rainstorm - the protection is in place before it's needed!

Use nighttime diapers for all sleep periods: Until this issue resolves, use overnight diapers for both naps and nights. These are more absorbent and can better contain wetness if a poop occurs, keeping your baby more comfortable.

Consider your baby's diet: Food choices can significantly impact bowel movement timing. Here's a helpful way to think about it:

Certain "P" produce—like papaya, passion fruit, and pumpkin puree—can naturally stimulate digestion. Offering these foods earlier in the day may help prevent nighttime surprises.

Similarly, meals rich in fiber—such as oatmeal, barley, and quinoa—can sometimes soften stools if eaten too late, so scheduling them for breakfast or lunch might be a better choice.

On the flip side, many parents have noticed that binding foods—like mashed bananas, apple puree, and rice cereal—can help firm up stools and reduce untimely trips to the potty. Some families even find that starchy options, such as mashed sweet potatoes, work well for keeping bowel movements on track.

Every baby’s digestive system is unique, so it’s important to observe how your little one responds and adjust food types and timing accordingly.

Encourage movement after eating: Give your baby plenty of free play and floor time after meals. This physical activity can stimulate the digestive system, potentially encouraging a bowel movement before sleep time.

One mom I worked with created what she called "poop prompting time" about 45 minutes before nap - she'd give her baby a warm bath followed by some tummy massage and free movement time on a play mat. This gentle routine often resulted in a pre-nap poop rather than a mid-nap surprise!

Is Poop the Problem or a Symptom?

Sometimes what appears to be a pooping problem is actually a symptom of a different sleep issue. Ask yourself these questions:

Is your baby waking early and then pooping, or does the need to poop wake them early?

Are short naps causing a pattern where your baby poops after a too-short nap?

Are wake windows not quite long enough, resulting in your baby using the crib as playtime (which often leads to pooping)?

In these cases, poop isn't the problem but rather a symptom of another sleep issue. If any of these scenarios sound familiar, check out the relevant videos in this program - early morning wakings, short naps, or wake window adjustments might be the real solution you need.

For example, I worked with a family whose 9-month-old was consistently pooping 20 minutes into the morning nap. When we looked more closely, we realized the wake window before that nap was too short - baby wasn't tired enough for a full nap. By extending morning wake time by 30 minutes, their little one started taking a proper nap and shifted pooping to after waking!

When to Talk to Your Doctor

If you've tried adjusting diet, timing, and sleep schedule factors but still face persistent pooping issues during sleep, it's worth having a conversation with your pediatrician. They might have additional suggestions or want to rule out any digestive concerns.

Some questions to consider:

Is your baby's stool normal in color and consistency?

Are they experiencing any discomfort with bowel movements?

Has there been any recent change in diet or introduction of new foods?

Is your baby growing and gaining weight appropriately?

Having this information ready for your doctor will help them provide the most useful guidance.

Remember, like so many aspects of baby development, poop problems during sleep are usually a phase that passes (no pun intended!). Most families find that with some strategic adjustments, their little one's digestive system eventually syncs up better with their sleep schedule.

When Sleep Skills Meet Real Life: Final Thoughts

As we wrap up this journey through common sleep challenges, I want to leave you with some thoughts about balancing sleep skills with real life. Because that's really what this is all about, isn't it? Not perfect sleep, but sustainable, healthy sleep that allows your family to thrive.

The greatest gift of healthy sleep skills isn't just the sleep itself – it's the confidence and flexibility it brings to your family life. A well-rested child with solid sleep skills can handle the occasional disruption, adapt to new situations, and return to their healthy patterns when needed. And well-rested parents are more patient, present, and able to enjoy their children fully.

The Real Meaning of Sleep Success

Success doesn't mean your baby never has a rough night. It doesn't mean you never adjust bedtime for a special family occasion or that naps are never on the go. Sleep success means you have:

A child who generally sleeps well and wakes rested

The tools to navigate challenges when they arise

The confidence to make exceptions when life calls for it

The ability to get back on track when needed

I remember talking with a mom who apologized for "failing" at sleep training because they'd taken a weekend trip and her baby slept in the pack and play in their hotel room. She was genuinely worried she'd undone all their hard work! But that's not failure – that's living life with the flexibility good sleep skills provide.

Your Toolbox for the Journey Ahead

Throughout this program, you've gained so many tools for your parenting toolbox:

You understand age-appropriate sleep needs and patterns

You recognize the difference between developmental phases and true sleep problems

You know how to balance consistency with flexibility

You can identify when physical needs require a different approach

You have strategies for navigating major transitions like travel, siblings, and milestone development

You recognize the importance of your calm, confident presence

These tools will serve you far beyond the specific sleep challenges we've discussed. The problem-solving approach you've practiced here will help with many parenting challenges in the years to come.

The Confidence to Trust Yourself

Perhaps the most important outcome of this journey is the confidence to trust yourself and your knowledge of your unique child. There will always be conflicting advice, well-meaning suggestions, and moments of doubt. But you now have a foundation of knowledge combined with your deep understanding of your child.

That combination – evidence-based practices plus parental intuition – is incredibly powerful. Trust it.

When in doubt, remember these key principles:

Most disruptions are temporary. Whether it's illness, a developmental leap, or a life transition, this challenging phase will pass.

Consistency builds security. Your steady, predictable response helps your child feel safe, even during changes.

Flexibility isn't failure. Adapting to life's needs doesn't mean you've abandoned good sleep habits.

You know your baby best. Your observations and instincts about your child matter deeply.

Support is available when needed. You don't have to figure this out alone – whether it's your pediatrician, a sleep consultant, or trusted resources, reach out when you need help.

Looking Ahead

As your little one grows, sleep needs and challenges will continue to evolve. The baby who fought naps becomes the toddler who stalls at bedtime. The toddler who climbed out of the crib becomes the preschooler with nightmares. Each stage brings its own joys and challenges.

But here's what I know for sure: the investment you've made in healthy sleep habits now creates a foundation that benefits your child throughout childhood. You're not just helping them sleep better tonight – you're teaching them a life skill that supports their development, health, and wellbeing for years to come.

You've done the hard work. You've weathered challenges. You've stayed consistent when it was difficult. That commitment matters enormously, and it's making a difference every single day.

So be proud of how far you've come. Trust the foundation you've built. And know that whatever bumps lie ahead on your parenting journey, you have the tools, the knowledge, and the inner strength to navigate them with confidence.

Sleep well, families. You've got this.
