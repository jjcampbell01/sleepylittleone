                Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now. My daughter Lily hadn't 
                slept through the night in 14 months. I was running on 3 hours of broken 
                sleep, my marriage was strained, and I felt like I was failing as a mother.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After trying every method out there—and failing—I dove deep into sleep 
                science research. I discovered that most approaches only address behavior, 
                not the underlying biological systems that control sleep.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-foreground font-semibold">
                That's when I developed the Triple-Alignment Framework. Within one week, 
                Lily was sleeping 12 hours straight. Within two weeks, our entire family 
                was transformed.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Since then, I've become a certified pediatric sleep consultant and helped 
                over 10,000 families achieve the same results—without cry-it-out methods, 
                without breaking attachment bonds, and without compromising your values.
